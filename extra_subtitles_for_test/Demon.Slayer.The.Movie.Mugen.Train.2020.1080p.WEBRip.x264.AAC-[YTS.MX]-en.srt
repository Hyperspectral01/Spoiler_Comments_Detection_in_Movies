1
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,270
Kenichi...

2
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,060
Hideki...

3
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,970
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,190
Masao...

5
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,060
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,359
Yuta...

7
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,469
Yaichi...

8
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,609
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,490
Isao...

10
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,660
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,410
Yukio...

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,120
Takahiro...

13
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:23,059
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,639
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:32,919
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,939
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,319
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:56,369
I've already received seven cases
caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:03,038
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:08,869
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,359
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:22,829
the one thing they can never crush
is a human's will.

23
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,328
No matter how battered we are,

24
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:31,438
we will always rise up again to fight.

25
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:56,918
MUGEN

26
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:24,038
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

27
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,728
Are the police still around?

28
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,538
We'll have to go even if they are.

29
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,497
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

30
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:36,717
Hey, idiot!

31
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:38,357
We should go, too!

32
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,557
Hey, don't leave me behind!

33
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,607
W-Wait up!

34
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,058
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

35
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:51,388
Zenitsu!

36
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:08,487
So fast!

37
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,487
Sorry! We're very sorry!

38
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,277
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

39
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:14,507
So freakin' fast!

40
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,417
Ma'am, is that all right?

41
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:25,277
Thank you.

42
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,727
Sorry to trouble you.

43
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:27,547
Oh no.

44
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,107
It's the least I can do.

45
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:41,856
He's a Hashira, right?

46
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:43,486
This Rengoku person...

47
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:46,766
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

48
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:47,866
Sure,

49
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:51,896
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

50
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,166
Hey!

51
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,586
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

52
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,337
Delicious!

53
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:29,366
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

54
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:31,986
Delicious!

55
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,656
Delicious!

56
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:35,666
Delicious!

57
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:39,666
Delicious!

58
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:42,256
Delicious!

59
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:45,756
Delicious!

60
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:48,335
Delicious!

61
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:50,755
Delicious!

62
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,015
Delicious!

63
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:56,265
Delicious!

64
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,515
Delicious!

65
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:01,795
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

66
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,036
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

67
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,876
Not just some random glutton?

68
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,516
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

69
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:07,956
Delicious!

70
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,285
Um, excuse me...

71
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,095
Delicious!

72
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,755
R-Rengoku?

73
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,585
Delicious!

74
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,835
Uh, we really get that part already.

75
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,605
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

76
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:30,684
Yes.

77
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,464
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

78
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:38,355
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

79
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:42,385
I see. And inside that box there...

80
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:43,605
Yes.

81
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,705
It's my sister Nezuko.

82
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,345
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

83
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,784
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

84
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,034
Have a seat here.

85
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:08,774
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

86
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,465
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

87
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:15,134
What are you three doing here?

88
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,964
A mission?

89
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,404
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

90
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:25,984
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

91
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:29,574
Yes! I see now! Understood!

92
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:30,734
Right.

93
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,764
Also, there's one more thing.

94
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,954
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

95
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,913
What is it? Let's hear it.

96
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,613
About my father...

97
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,664
What about your father?

98
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,344
Well, he was really frail.

99
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:48,704
Was he really?

100
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:52,154
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

101
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:53,854
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

102
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:55,184
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

103
00:07:57,604 --> 00:07:58,574
The thing is...

104
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,604
What's up?

105
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,713
Hinokami Kagura...

106
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,263
Dance!

107
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:08,133
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

108
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:12,063
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

109
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,453
I was hoping you'd tell me.

110
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:20,904
Right!

111
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,313
But I know nothing!

112
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,553
I've never even heard
the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

113
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:33,163
But it's truly commendable that your father
was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

114
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:35,553
All right, end of discussion!

115
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:37,633
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

116
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:41,443
You should become my Tsuguko,
my apprentice! I'll look after you!

117
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:45,152
Hold on a second!
And just what are you looking at?

118
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,102
<i>He's totally weird, all right.</i>

119
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,683
Flame Breathing has a long history.

120
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:56,313
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

121
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:57,763
Flame.

122
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,063
Water.

123
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:00,353
Wind.

124
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,663
Stone.

125
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,783
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

126
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,412
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

127
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,372
SOUND

128
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,372
LOVE

129
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,372
MIST
SERPENT
FLOWER
INSECT

130
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,662
Mist is a fork of Wind.

131
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,532
Young Mizoguchi!

132
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:16,662
What color is your sword?

133
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:20,802
My name's Kamado.
And the color is black.

134
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,302
A black sword, huh?

135
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:24,353
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

136
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,353
For real?

137
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,002
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

138
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:35,362
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

139
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,312
Come to me, and I'll train you!

140
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:41,112
You can rest easy now!

141
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,592
No, thank you!

142
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:45,062
And just what are you looking at?

143
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:55,961
<i>He's strange,
but he seems to be very caring.</i>

144
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:59,412
<i>And from his scent,
I can pick up his strong sense of justice.</i>

145
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:05,882
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

146
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,552
That's dangerous, you idiot!

147
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:12,482
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

148
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,401
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

149
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:19,151
You never know when a demon might appear.

150
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:25,651
You're kidding, right?
Demons show up on this train?

151
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:27,391
Sure do!

152
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,551
What? They do?

153
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:33,222
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

154
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:34,972
Nooo!

155
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,751
I'm getting off!

156
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:42,281
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

157
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:46,851
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

158
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,761
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

159
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:59,850
Right, I see!
I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

160
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:08,951
May I...

161
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:10,531
see your...

162
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,401
tickets, please?

163
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,811
What's he doing?

164
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:19,241
The conductor's going to check
your ticket and punch a hole in it.

165
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:23,770
TOKYO - MUGEN

166
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,630
Here.

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,110
<i>What is this?</i>

168
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,530
<i>There's a horrible scent.</i>

169
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,780
Thank you...

170
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,950
very much.

171
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:10,549
Mr. Conductor...

172
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,680
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

173
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,180
As this is an emergency,
please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

174
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:41,029
Was it a Blood Demon Art
that hid that massive body?

175
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,499
I had a hard time detecting you.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,960
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

177
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:55,909
my bright red Flame Blade
will burn you to the bone!

178
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,149
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

179
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,149
<i>First Form...</i>

180
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:16,388
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

181
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:27,779
Amazing.

182
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,279
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

183
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:35,278
There's still one more.

184
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:36,958
Come with me!

185
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,258
All right!

186
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:44,208
D-Don't leave me behind!

187
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,698
You will not lay a finger on that man!

188
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,628
Didn't you hear me?

189
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,548
I said I'm your opponent.

190
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:20,017
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

191
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,127
All right!

192
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,437
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

193
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,468
We gotta save the passenger first!

194
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,058
It won't matter
once I destroy that thing!

195
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:45,527
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

196
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:48,947
We're good to go now.

197
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,947
Let's finish him off in short order.

198
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,048
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

199
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,048
<i>Second Form...</i>

200
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,707
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

201
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,226
Tha...

202
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,227
Tha...

203
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:36,157
That was awesome, Bro!
Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

204
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,967
Please make me your apprentice!

205
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,767
Fine by me! I'll make
a fine swordsman out of you!

206
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,797
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

207
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,297
I'll train all of you!

208
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:49,246
Big Bro Rengoku!

209
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:50,716
Bro!

210
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,806
- Bro!
- Bro!

211
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,676
Big Bro Rengoku!

212
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,046
I did as I was told! I punched
their tickets and put them to sleep!

213
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,976
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

214
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:48,446
Please let me be reunited
with my dead wife and daughter!

215
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,106
I'm begging you.

216
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,396
I'm begging you.

217
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,305
Sure thing.

218
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:05,225
DREAM

219
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,795
You did a good job.

220
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,625
Go to sleep.

221
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,996
Have a nice dream
where you can meet your family.

222
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,296
Excuse me.

223
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:21,475
What do you want us to do?

224
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:26,475
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

225
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:29,145
Wait here until then.

226
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:36,275
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up
sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

227
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:41,744
When you tie the ropes,
be careful not to touch their bodies.

228
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:46,245
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

229
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:50,155
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

230
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,675
so that you can have blissful dreams.

231
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,845
Okay.

232
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,894
<i>What's going on? What happened?</i>

233
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,524
<i>Calm down.</i>

234
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:04,404
<i>Calm down.</i>

235
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,854
<i>You have to calm down.</i>

236
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,253
Hey!

237
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:20,253
It's Big Bro!

238
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:22,423
Welcome home, Big Bro!

239
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:24,343
Did you sell the charcoal?

240
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,023
Big Bro?

241
00:19:55,792 --> 00:20:00,123
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

242
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:12,593
To be able to die while dreaming...

243
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:15,143
Just how lucky are you?

244
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:19,502
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

245
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:25,802
A human's driving force
is the heart, the spirit!

246
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:32,322
All you have to do
is destroy the spiritual core.

247
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,693
You can kill them just like that!

248
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,992
All human hearts are the same.

249
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:44,202
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

250
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,422
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

251
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:53,752
That's right. Don't forget
what he warned us about.

252
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,101
Take a deep, slow breath...

253
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,022
while you count.

254
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:13,022
<i>Do that, and you'll fall asleep.</i>

255
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:14,802
<i>One...</i>

256
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,192
<i>Two...</i>

257
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:17,872
<i>Three...</i>

258
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,792
<i>Four...</i>

259
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:21,622
<i>Five...</i>

260
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:23,621
<i>Six...</i>

261
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:33,071
And then, we were surprised
because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

262
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,971
What a weirdo!

263
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:40,062
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

264
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:43,422
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

265
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:49,001
You don't have a fever, do you?

266
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,021
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

267
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:54,991
I'm all right.

268
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,521
Are you sure?

269
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,071
Hey! You come back here!

270
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,711
Gotcha!

271
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:03,901
What do you think you're doing?

272
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:07,900
Hey! You stop that right now!

273
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
Seems like...

274
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,701
I was having a bad dream or something.

275
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:20,671
Falling deeper into sleep,
deep in their dreams...

276
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:24,041
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

277
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:27,801
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

278
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,130
Even in the stomach,
deep in their dreams...

279
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,220
Looks like fun.

280
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,800
You're starting to have
a happy dream, aren't you?

281
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,550
You are falling...

282
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,070
You are falling...

283
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,321
into a dream.

284
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
It's a deep slumber.

285
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,320
They can...

286
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,390
no longer awaken.

287
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,090
LOWER ONE

288
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,670
This way!

289
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,799
The peaches over here taste great!

290
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,209
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

291
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,319
I'll make you a chaplet!

292
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,740
I can make these really great-looking ones...

293
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,400
Nezuko!

294
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,070
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

295
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,440
Zenitsu?

296
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,749
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

297
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:39,999
River?

298
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:44,249
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

299
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,999
I can't swim.

300
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:52,019
I-I'll just carry you on my back
and jump right over the river!

301
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:55,020
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

302
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,519
Just leave it to me!

303
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,019
Let's go!

304
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,089
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

305
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,958
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

306
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:23,878
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

307
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:25,708
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

308
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:27,229
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

309
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,049
Boss!

310
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:29,299
Boss!

311
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,049
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

312
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,679
PONJIRO

313
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,719
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

314
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,179
CHUITSU

315
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:41,219
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

316
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:47,738
Here he is!

317
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,318
All right, let's go! Showdown!

318
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,188
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

319
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,768
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

320
00:24:56,408 --> 00:25:00,019
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

321
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,119
Let's go!

322
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,449
- Hey!
- Hey!

323
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,218
<i>Why did I come here?</i>

324
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,448
<i>Oh, right.</i>

325
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,948
<i>To report to my father...</i>

326
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,368
<i>that I've become a Hashira.</i>

327
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,547
So what if you've become a Hashira?

328
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:12,348
Worthless.

329
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,017
It means nothing.

330
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:18,017
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

331
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,317
Neither you...

332
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,517
nor I.

333
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,947
Brother...

334
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,996
Was our father pleased to hear your news?

335
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:41,247
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

336
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:46,297
<i>He wasn't always like that.</i>

337
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:50,887
<i>After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps.</i>

338
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:53,767
<i>He was a passionate man.</i>

339
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:58,096
<i>And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.</i>

340
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:00,466
<i>Suddenly.</i>

341
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,946
<i>The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...</i>

342
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:10,986
<i>Why?</i>

343
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,947
<i>It's pointless to think
about such things, so stop.</i>

344
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:21,216
<i>Senjuro is even worse off.</i>

345
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:27,026
<i>He barely has any memories of our mother
who died of illness when he was very young,</i>

346
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:29,466
<i>and just look at the state our father is in.</i>

347
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,066
I'm going to be honest.

348
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,516
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

349
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:42,185
He told me that it meant nothing.

350
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:46,435
But that's not enough
to extinguish my passion!

351
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,686
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

352
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:52,696
I'll never give in!

353
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,696
And Senjuro...

354
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:59,446
You're not like me.

355
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:01,916
You have a big brother...

356
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,945
who believes in his little brother.

357
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:09,795
No matter what path you take,
you're going to become a fine human being!

358
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:12,215
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

359
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:13,435
Let's do our best!

360
00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:15,635
Let's do our best-and live on!

361
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:17,935
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

362
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,645
Looking good.

363
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,085
Those ropes that I created are used...

364
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:33,535
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

365
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:38,865
I always fight with the utmost caution.

366
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:44,215
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

367
00:28:44,915 --> 00:28:50,584
I'll enjoy the feast
after killing the Demon Slayers.

368
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,145
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

369
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:03,265
Relax your shoulders.

370
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:05,935
Like this?

371
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:07,235
That's right.

372
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:11,144
Close call. He's right there.

373
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,194
<i>I have to make sure he doesn't see me!</i>

374
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,784
<i>I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!</i>

375
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:19,694
<i>Hurry!</i>

376
00:29:21,614 --> 00:29:24,914
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

377
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:30,085
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

378
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:32,345
DREAM

379
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:38,014
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

380
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:35,874
SUBCONSCIOUS

381
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,554
CORE

382
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:40,934
That's what you must destroy.

383
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:46,684
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

384
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:55,194
There it is!

385
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:59,693
The scenery doesn't end here,
but you can't go any further.

386
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:06,034
<i>I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!</i>

387
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:12,834
<i>And then, I'll get to see
a happy dream myself!</i>

388
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:24,913
<i>What an odd realm of the subconscious.</i>

389
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:26,643
<i>It's hot.</i>

390
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,183
<i>It's burning up.</i>

391
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,483
<i>I have to hurry.</i>

392
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,033
Found it!

393
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:50,083
The spiritual core!

394
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:54,333
I've never seen a red one before.

395
00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:00,593
All I have to do is destroy this and...

396
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:02,383
It'll be my turn to...

397
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:31,312
<i>I thought humans couldn't move
while they were under a spell.</i>

398
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:38,162
<i>What a strong survival instinct he has!</i>

399
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:49,582
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

400
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,242
Wow!

401
00:31:51,502 --> 00:31:54,622
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

402
00:31:54,652 --> 00:31:57,062
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

403
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:01,842
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

404
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:04,312
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

405
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:07,262
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

406
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:09,252
Can you get the grill ready for me?

407
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:10,831
Okay!

408
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,131
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

409
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:15,832
Okay, I'll be in charge
of flipping them over, then!

410
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,302
Me, too!

411
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:19,922
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

412
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,612
No fair!

413
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,041
There.

414
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,261
Nezuko, let's go.

415
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:50,612
What did I just say?

416
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:54,781
I'm back!

417
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,391
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

418
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,581
Yeah, I'm home!

419
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,211
Welcome home, Big Bro!

420
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:09,331
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

421
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:12,331
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

422
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,741
In broad daylight?

423
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
She's not supposed to?

424
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,090
Well...

425
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,561
Um...

426
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:23,761
Tanjiro...

427
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,841
Could you get the bath ready?

428
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,681
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

429
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,231
<i>I keep saying all these strange things.</i>

430
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:37,111
Am I tired maybe?

431
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,110
Huh? It's gone.

432
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,690
I wonder what that was
for just a split second.

433
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,540
A toolbox perhaps?

434
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:58,681
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

435
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,380
Wake up!

436
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,880
Wake up!

437
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,980
Wake up!

438
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,810
You're under attack!

439
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,060
It's a dream!

440
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,550
This is a dream!

441
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,750
Wake up now!

442
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,060
<i>I see... That's right, I'm...</i>

443
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,229
<i>on board the train!</i>

444
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:26,079
Wake up and fight!

445
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:27,579
Fight!

446
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,460
Fight!

447
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,970
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

448
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,580
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

449
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,150
Why are you always
taking food away from Big Bro?

450
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,569
What's your problem?

451
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,429
You just had seconds!

452
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:53,679
<i>No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!</i>

453
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:55,979
<i>How can I get out of it?</i>

454
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:58,179
<i>Now that I've realized that it's a dream...</i>

455
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:01,189
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

456
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,759
I have to wake up...

457
00:35:58,748 --> 00:35:59,928
Big Bro!

458
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,078
- What should we do? The fire is―
- Big Bro!

459
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:06,658
<i>That's Nezuko's scent!</i>

460
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,409
<i>It's Nezuko's blood!</i>

461
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,929
<i>Nezuko...</i>

462
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:13,179
<i>Nezuko!</i>

463
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:19,058
<i>My uniform...</i>

464
00:36:19,398 --> 00:36:20,508
<i>My Nichirin Sword...</i>

465
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:22,728
<i>I'm waking up!</i>

466
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,338
<i>Little by little.</i>

467
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:26,028
<i>Little by little!</i>

468
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:27,878
Big Bro?

469
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:30,048
Big Bro, are you all right?

470
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:31,278
Big Bro?

471
00:36:32,408 --> 00:36:33,328
Sorry.

472
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,028
I have to go.

473
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,857
<i>I have to hurry back!</i>

474
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:44,878
I'm sorry.

475
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:46,268
Big Bro!

476
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:48,038
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

477
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,258
<i>If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...</i>

478
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,227
<i>I have to find him
and slash him right away!</i>

479
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:04,277
<i>Where is he? I have to...</i>

480
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:08,807
Where are you going, Big Bro?

481
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,708
I picked lots of vegetables today!

482
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,877
Mom! This way!

483
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,877
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

484
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:33,207
Mom?

485
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:35,987
Tanjiro, are you all right?

486
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:38,337
Big Bro...

487
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,886
What's the matter, Tanjiro?
Why are you dressed like that?

488
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:01,937
I wish I could stay here...

489
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:03,737
forever.

490
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:09,126
I wish I could turn around and go back,

491
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:14,626
<i>By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.</i>

492
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:16,536
<i>Right here.</i>

493
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:19,786
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

494
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:22,927
<i>they'd all have been alive and well now.</i>

495
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:29,306
<i>And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.</i>

496
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,596
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

497
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:35,546
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

498
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:40,056
<i>I should be here
making charcoal every day</i>

499
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:43,576
<i>I never would've laid a hand on a sword!</i>

500
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:48,486
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

501
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:51,905
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

502
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:08,226
<i>But I've lost them now.</i>

503
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:10,426
<i>I can never go back!</i>

504
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:15,335
Big Bro!

505
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:18,355
Don't leave us behind!

506
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,775
<i>Sorry!</i>

507
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:28,405
<i>I'm sorry, Rokuta!</i>

508
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:33,026
<i>We can't be together anymore.</i>

509
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:38,505
<i>But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?</i>

510
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,085
<i>I'll be thinking of you all!</i>

511
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,955
<i>There are lots of things to thank you for.</i>

512
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:51,435
<i>Lots of things to be sorry for!</i>

513
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:53,825
<i>But I will never forget you!</i>

514
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,555
<i>No matter what,
my heart will always be with you!</i>

515
00:39:58,524 --> 00:39:59,554
<i>So, please...</i>

516
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:02,054
<i>forgive me!</i>

517
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:13,735
<i>I have to destroy
his spiritual core right away.</i>

518
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,474
<i>So, this is the inside of his heart?</i>

519
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,975
<i>How can it be so beautiful?</i>

520
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,484
<i>It's so endlessly vast...</i>

521
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:44,274
<i>and...</i>

522
00:40:45,524 --> 00:40:47,274
<i>also warm.</i>

523
00:40:57,404 --> 00:41:00,504
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

524
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:06,533
What's with this realm
of the subconscious?

525
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:11,784
And that creepy naked boar...

526
00:41:12,124 --> 00:41:14,374
Seriously, this is insane.

527
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:23,114
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

528
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:25,804
You stupid naked boar!

529
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:38,573
It's pitch-dark.

530
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:44,294
It's pitch-dark,
and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

531
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:48,074
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

532
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,253
Do I have to grope around
to find his spiritual core?

533
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,333
You must be kidding me.

534
00:41:58,003 --> 00:41:59,053
What was that?

535
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:13,272
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

536
00:42:13,602 --> 00:42:17,022
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

537
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:20,993
I'm so going to kill you.

538
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,433
Where's Nezuko?

539
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:26,263
Wh-Who the heck knows?

540
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,283
All right, then... Die!

541
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:35,952
Nooo!

542
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:42,282
They're having trouble, aren't they?

543
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:44,182
I wonder why.

544
00:42:44,602 --> 00:42:48,302
They haven't destroyed
any of the spiritual cores yet.

545
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,553
Oh well...

546
00:42:51,143 --> 00:42:55,053
I guess it doesn't matter,
since they're buying me some time.

547
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,072
<i>Not here.</i>

548
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:02,782
<i>But I can smell a demon, even faintly.</i>

549
00:43:03,402 --> 00:43:04,652
<i>What's this, though?</i>

550
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:07,072
<i>It's like there's a film over everything!</i>

551
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:10,822
<i>There's a faint demon scent everywhere!</i>

552
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,072
<i>I can't tell the exact location!</i>

553
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:15,122
I have to hurry!

554
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:17,582
Nezuko's bleeding!

555
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:21,831
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

556
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:23,751
<i>What should I do?</i>

557
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:28,722
<i>Am I unable to use
Total Concentration Breathing now?</i>

558
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:32,222
<i>Am I just asleep right now?</i>

559
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:35,602
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

560
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:41,821
Take up your sword.

561
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:46,481
There's something you must cut.

562
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:58,782
<i>There's something...</i>

563
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:01,172
<i>I must cut.</i>

564
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:04,751
<i>There's something I must cut...</i>

565
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:06,781
<i>in order to wake up.</i>

566
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:09,881
<i>I think I know what it is.</i>

567
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,681
<i>But what if I'm wrong?</i>

568
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:17,931
<i>If what happens in this dream
has an effect on reality, too...</i>

569
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:19,931
<i>there'll be no going back.</i>

570
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:24,931
<i>Don't hesitate! Do it!</i>

571
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,570
<i>You have to do it!</i>

572
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,530
<i>My death in this dream
will lead me to reality!</i>

573
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,151
<i>In other words...</i>

574
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:33,821
<i>what I have to cut is...</i>

575
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:39,281
<i>my own neck!</i>

576
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,420
I'm all right. I'm alive.

577
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,981
Nezuko! Are you okay?

578
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:10,520
Nezuko...

579
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,600
Zenitsu...

580
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,400
Inosuke...

581
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,330
Rengoku...

582
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,500
Who are these people?

583
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,000
<i>They're all connected
by the wrists with ropes.</i>

584
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,680
<i>Rope...</i>

585
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,329
<i>What's this?</i>

586
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,049
<i>It's burned off.</i>

587
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:37,519
<i>Nezuko's burning blood did it?</i>

588
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,520
<i>It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!</i>

589
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,680
This smell... The ticket!

590
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,720
<i>I knew it. It's giving off
a faint demon smell, too.</i>

591
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,820
<i>We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.</i>

592
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,729
<i>This must be a demon's work!</i>

593
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,279
<i>Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?</i>

594
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:05,229
<i>I don't know why...</i>

595
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:10,169
<i>but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.</i>

596
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,970
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

597
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,330
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

598
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:26,319
Zenitsu! Wake up!

599
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:29,569
Wake up, Zenitsu!
You have to wake up!

600
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:34,429
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

601
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:36,679
Inosuke...

602
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:41,928
There, there... Sorry, okay?

603
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:43,578
Thanks.

604
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,449
You did a great job, Nezuko.

605
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:51,449
<i>It's no good. These two don't wake up.</i>

606
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:53,699
<i>What can I do?</i>

607
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:57,499
Rengoku―

608
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:02,128
What are you doing?

609
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:08,128
<i>Is a demon controlling her?</i>

610
00:47:08,388 --> 00:47:09,928
Get out of our way!

611
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:14,018
Thanks to you guys,
we won't be able to have dreams!

612
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,199
<i>Is she acting of her own free will?</i>

613
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,569
<i>This man, too?</i>

614
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:26,618
What do you think you're doing?

615
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:29,478
If you're awake,
you'd better help us out!

616
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:33,518
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

617
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:37,748
I'm going to tell him, and then,
he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

618
00:47:40,668 --> 00:47:43,378
<i>Is he the one
who was connected to me?</i>

619
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:45,218
<i>Tuberculosis...</i>

620
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:46,877
<i>He's sick.</i>

621
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,877
<i>Poor man.</i>

622
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,898
<i>What this demon did is unforgivable.</i>

623
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:54,978
<i>He took advantage of their weak souls!</i>

624
00:47:57,148 --> 00:47:58,068
Sorry.

625
00:47:58,898 --> 00:48:01,568
I have to go fight.

626
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,067
You want to stay
inside a happy dream, don't you?

627
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,527
I know.

628
00:48:23,587 --> 00:48:26,768
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

629
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:34,817
If only this was the dream...

630
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,117
<i>I was willing...</i>

631
00:48:47,147 --> 00:48:54,366
<i>to hurt others if it meant
I could escape from the pain of this illness.</i>

632
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:58,366
<i>But it was warm...</i>

633
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:02,127
<i>inside your dream and inside your soul.</i>

634
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:07,127
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

635
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:13,857
The air is so clear, and it feels good.

636
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:24,896
Is that his spiritual core?

637
00:49:25,436 --> 00:49:26,896
Why are you showing it to me?

638
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:35,027
Did you bring me here
because I was searching for it?

639
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:42,366
No way!

640
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:45,696
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

641
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:47,996
Why would you...

642
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:56,046
<i>The shining little sprites
inside you lit up my heart.</i>

643
00:49:58,546 --> 00:50:00,125
Are you all right?

644
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:03,875
Thank you.

645
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:07,266
Be careful.

646
00:50:11,236 --> 00:50:12,366
Right!

647
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:13,776
Nezuko!

648
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:27,575
<i>The smell is overpowering!</i>

649
00:50:27,915 --> 00:50:28,825
<i>So heavy!</i>

650
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:32,825
<i>The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!</i>

651
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:35,825
<i>Was I asleep in such an awful scent?</i>

652
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,466
<i>Even if each car was closed off and airtight,</i>

653
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:41,326
<i>I can't believe I was!</i>

654
00:50:41,966 --> 00:50:43,176
<i>I was useless!</i>

655
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:45,565
<i>The demon's upwind...</i>

656
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:47,345
<i>Is he in the first car?</i>

657
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,475
Nezuko, don't come!

658
00:50:52,935 --> 00:50:54,475
Stay away from me and wait!

659
00:50:55,015 --> 00:50:56,645
Go wake everyone up!

660
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:06,744
What? You're awake?

661
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,574
Good morning!

662
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:12,665
You could've stayed asleep.

663
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,165
<i>It was him!</i>

664
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:18,095
Why did you wake up?

665
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:23,095
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

666
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:29,094
I could've shown you a dream
where your family was being slaughtered.

667
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:31,854
Would you have liked that one better?

668
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,524
No, of course not.
Too distressing, right?

669
00:51:37,734 --> 00:51:39,314
All right, next...

670
00:51:39,894 --> 00:51:43,564
Why don't I show you a dream
where your father comes back to life?

671
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:54,824
<i>What I really love..</i>

672
00:51:55,384 --> 00:52:01,824
<i>is to show people nightmares
right after a happy dream.</i>

673
00:52:02,354 --> 00:52:06,564
<i>I just adore the sight
of a distorted human face.</i>

674
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,344
<i>I get such a kick out of that!</i>

675
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:18,593
<i>How enthralling is it to gaze at someone
shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?</i>

676
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:22,094
<i>But I don't usually let my guard down.</i>

677
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:27,114
<i>So, it may take longer,
but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers.</i>

678
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,324
<i>I mixed my blood
with the ink on the tickets.</i>

679
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:36,863
<i>Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...</i>

680
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,163
<i>the spell activates.</i>

681
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:44,963
<i>And yet...</i>

682
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:49,013
<i>how did this one manage to wake up?</i>

683
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,874
<i>And he found the way to wake up in a short time.</i>

684
00:52:53,544 --> 00:53:00,313
<i>Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...</i>

685
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:04,943
is so enormous!

686
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:10,143
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

687
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,813
I won't let you...

688
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,613
get away with this!

689
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,602
<i>What's that? I see he's wearing earrings.</i>

690
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,822
How lucky is that?

691
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:29,373
So, he came right to me!

692
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:32,053
This is like a dream!

693
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:36,643
Now I can receive
even more blood of Master Muzan!

694
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:40,733
And once I become more powerful,

695
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:45,642
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

696
00:53:48,262 --> 00:53:49,942
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

697
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:52,612
<i>Tenth Form...</i>

698
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:55,112
<i>Constant Flux!</i>

699
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,323
<i>Blood Demon Art!</i>

700
00:54:04,193 --> 00:54:08,092
<i>Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.</i>

701
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:12,092
Go to sleep!

702
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,122
<i>He's not falling asleep.</i>

703
00:54:27,861 --> 00:54:28,771
Go to sleep.

704
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:37,272
Go to sleep.

705
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:42,662
Go to sleep!

706
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:52,121
Go... to... sleep!

707
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,411
<i>It's not working. But why not?</i>

708
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:58,061
<i>No, that's not what this is.</i>

709
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:02,471
<i>He's falling under this spell over and over!</i>

710
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:12,391
<i>He's aware that he's under the spell right away.</i>

711
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:18,641
<i>And he's committing suicide
in order to awaken!</i>

712
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:28,131
<i>Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...</i>

713
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,021
<i>to take his own life with his own hands...</i>

714
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:33,791
<i>that takes incredible willpower!</i>

715
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:35,710
<i>This brat...</i>

716
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,620
<i>is insane!</i>

717
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:53,111
Why didn't you save us?

718
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,970
What were you doing
while we were being murdered?

719
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,740
How could you be the only one to survive?

720
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:18,321
Why do you think you were here?

721
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:20,740
You're so useless!

722
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,470
It should've been you that died.

723
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,840
How dare you go on living
without a care.

724
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:47,610
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

725
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,990
Don't you dare...

726
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,910
insult...

727
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,070
my family!

728
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:21,770
<i>It was way too easy.</i>

729
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,360
<i>Could this be a dream, too?</i>

730
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,719
<i>Or was this demon weaker than him?</i>

731
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:32,719
I can totally see why...

732
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:38,319
he ordered me to kill you,
the boy with the earrings,

733
00:57:39,879 --> 00:57:42,489
along with the Hashira!

734
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,989
Your very existence is, like...

735
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:50,318
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

736
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,088
<i>He's not dying?</i>

737
00:57:52,638 --> 00:57:55,259
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

738
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:58,669
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

739
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:05,419
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

740
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:10,019
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

741
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:14,488
It's so easy
even an infant would understand.

742
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:20,518
It's because the body over there
was no longer my main body.

743
00:58:21,108 --> 00:58:24,018
Same with this thing
that's talking to you now.

744
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:28,039
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

745
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:31,539
While you were snoozing away...

746
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:35,418
I fused with this train!

747
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:43,558
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

748
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,108
Look at your face.

749
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:49,308
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

750
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:53,408
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

751
00:58:53,438 --> 00:58:57,357
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

752
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:59,817
as well as my hostages.

753
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:04,348
So, do you think
you can protect them by yourself?

754
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:10,568
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

755
00:59:11,268 --> 00:59:14,388
Can you alone keep me
from devoring them?

756
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,887
<i>What should I do? What should I do?</i>

757
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,557
<i>The most I can protect on my own is two cars!</i>

758
00:59:27,587 --> 00:59:30,307
<i>Any more than that,
and I can't guarantee their safety!</i>

759
00:59:31,057 --> 00:59:34,518
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

760
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:39,158
This is no time to be sleeping!
Wake up, will you? Please!

761
00:59:39,687 --> 00:59:41,067
Nezuko!

762
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:43,907
Protect the sleeping passengers!

763
00:59:55,587 --> 00:59:57,537
Follow me, damn minions!

764
00:59:57,877 --> 00:59:58,867
All right!

765
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,087
<i>Explosive Awakening!</i>

766
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,286
Comin' through!

767
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:08,027
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

768
01:00:08,057 --> 01:00:09,307
Inosuke!

769
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:11,807
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

770
01:00:12,057 --> 01:00:14,057
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

771
01:00:14,357 --> 01:00:16,777
This whole train's turned into a demon!

772
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:20,057
Can you hear me?
This whole train is a demon!

773
01:00:21,977 --> 01:00:25,596
I knew it!
So, I was right on the money!

774
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:29,616
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

775
01:00:33,986 --> 01:00:36,866
<i>Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...</i>

776
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:39,366
<i>Crazy Cutting!</i>

777
01:00:44,177 --> 01:00:47,356
I'll save every last one of you guys!

778
01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:49,446
Fall onto your knees...

779
01:00:49,806 --> 01:00:51,636
and worship me!

780
01:00:51,926 --> 01:00:53,636
Glorify me!

781
01:00:53,976 --> 01:00:58,966
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

782
01:00:59,526 --> 01:01:01,736
I have to go save the passengers!

783
01:01:02,276 --> 01:01:05,816
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

784
01:01:30,926 --> 01:01:33,335
It's gone this far already?

785
01:01:36,355 --> 01:01:37,605
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

786
01:01:38,135 --> 01:01:39,465
<i>First Form...</i>

787
01:01:39,725 --> 01:01:40,765
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

788
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:45,305
<i>No good.</i>

789
01:01:45,605 --> 01:01:47,635
<i>This is never going to end!</i>

790
01:01:47,936 --> 01:01:49,966
<i>How am I supposed to fend it off?</i>

791
01:01:56,535 --> 01:02:01,985
<i>Damn Demon Slayer,
scurrying around inside me.</i>

792
01:02:02,405 --> 01:02:05,795
<i>You can cut all you want,
but I'll just keep regenerating.</i>

793
01:02:05,825 --> 01:02:09,915
<i>And then, after all your strength is depleted...</i>

794
01:02:10,475 --> 01:02:16,594
<i>I'm going to partake of those
200 passengers in a leisurely feast.</i>

795
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,284
<i>Thunder Breathing...</i>

796
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:31,404
<i>First Form...</i>

797
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:33,504
<i>Thunderclap and Flash!</i>

798
01:03:37,634 --> 01:03:38,754
<i>Sixfold.</i>

799
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:40,504
I'll protect you...

800
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,754
Nezuko!

801
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:47,003
Protect...

802
01:03:53,853 --> 01:03:55,433
<i>That sounded like thunder.</i>

803
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,243
<i>From one of the cars in the back?</i>

804
01:03:57,273 --> 01:03:59,203
<i>What's going on?</i>

805
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:01,103
<i>Is Zenitsu awake now?</i>

806
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:03,044
<i>What about Rengoku?</i>

807
01:04:03,074 --> 01:04:04,354
<i>And Nezuko?</i>

808
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:13,033
<i>I cannot do anything
but protect the people here!</i>

809
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:15,343
<i>This is bad! What should I do?</i>

810
01:04:15,373 --> 01:04:17,003
<i>We can't fight in coordination!</i>

811
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:20,253
<i>Are the passengers in the back all right?</i>

812
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:21,663
<i>Damn!</i>

813
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:23,533
<i>It's so cramped!</i>

814
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:26,353
<i>And so hard to swing my sword!</i>

815
01:04:32,722 --> 01:04:36,853
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

816
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,433
How could this be?

817
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:42,363
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

818
01:04:43,823 --> 01:04:45,203
If only I could crawl...

819
01:04:47,453 --> 01:04:48,863
under a rock!

820
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:57,032
What happened?

821
01:05:02,922 --> 01:05:04,552
<i>What was that?</i>

822
01:05:04,582 --> 01:05:06,212
<i>A demon attack?</i>

823
01:05:08,502 --> 01:05:10,003
Young Kamado!

824
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:13,003
Rengoku!

825
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:16,702
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

826
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:19,352
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

827
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,902
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

828
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:22,852
Okay!

829
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:25,102
This train has eight cars in all.

830
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:27,352
I'll protect the five in the rear.

831
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:31,602
The yellow boy and your sister
will be in charge of the rest.

832
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,472
You and the boar head boy...

833
01:05:33,502 --> 01:05:37,411
will go look for the demon's head
while keeping an eye on those three cars.

834
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:38,701
Head?

835
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:40,141
But this demon is―

836
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:43,952
No matter what form he's assumed,
so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

837
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:46,362
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

838
01:05:46,622 --> 01:05:48,502
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

839
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:54,522
<i>Amazing! I can't even see him!</i>

840
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:57,932
<i>Did the train shake earlier
because Rengoku was on the move?</i>

841
01:05:58,602 --> 01:06:01,431
<i>He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!</i>

842
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:03,681
<i>Five cars, all by himself?</i>

843
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:08,781
<i>This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!</i>

844
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:12,651
<i>The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!</i>

845
01:06:14,281 --> 01:06:16,902
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

846
01:06:17,262 --> 01:06:18,982
Shut up, or I'll kill you!

847
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:19,972
Up there, huh?

848
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:23,031
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

849
01:06:25,051 --> 01:06:26,161
But somehow...

850
01:06:26,551 --> 01:06:28,161
Somehow...

851
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,911
Somehow, he was awesome!

852
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:33,751
I'm so pissed!

853
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:37,381
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

854
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:39,211
You don't have to tell me!

855
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:42,621
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

856
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:44,650
With my all-out Seventh Form...

857
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,760
I found this master's weak spot!

858
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,151
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

859
01:06:50,181 --> 01:06:51,651
That's right, up front!

860
01:06:51,681 --> 01:06:54,511
And that front part
is a heck of a lot creepier!

861
01:06:55,071 --> 01:06:58,491
<i>The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,</i>

862
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:00,861
<i>but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!</i>

863
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:03,391
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

864
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:04,421
That's right!

865
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:05,361
Understood!

866
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,500
Okay, let's go!

867
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,000
Forward!

868
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,511
This is it, huh?

869
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:27,851
All right!

870
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,310
Inosuke!

871
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,560
Fishy, very fishy!

872
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,920
Especially around here!

873
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,310
Who the hell are you?

874
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,310
G-Get out of here!

875
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,310
The demon's head...

876
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,810
The demon's...

877
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,579
weak spot!

878
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:56,710
Gross!

879
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,050
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

880
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:02,960
That's way too many hands!

881
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,500
Uh-oh!

882
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:10,260
<i>Water Breathing, Sixth Form...</i>

883
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,760
<i>Whirlpool!</i>

884
01:08:19,769 --> 01:08:21,369
Inosuke, are you all right?

885
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:23,869
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

886
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:24,909
Yeah, I know!

887
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:28,859
<i>It's here...</i>

888
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,330
<i>It's right beneath!</i>

889
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,470
<i>Directly below this place.</i>

890
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,249
<i>The demon's scent is powerful!</i>

891
01:08:35,509 --> 01:08:38,359
Inosuke! The demon's head
is right below here!

892
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:41,229
Don't boss me around!
I'm the leader!

893
01:08:41,259 --> 01:08:42,129
Fine!

894
01:08:42,769 --> 01:08:43,879
Just watch.

895
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,009
<i>Beast Breathing, Second Fang...</i>

896
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:50,129
<i>Slice!</i>

897
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:57,628
It's the bone.

898
01:08:58,048 --> 01:08:59,528
<i>His neck bone!</i>

899
01:09:00,318 --> 01:09:02,979
<i>Water Breathing, Eighth Form...</i>

900
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,309
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

901
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:10,149
<i>It blocked it!</i>

902
01:09:26,248 --> 01:09:27,878
<i>The gash is closing up!</i>

903
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:30,158
<i>It's regenerating so fast!</i>

904
01:09:30,468 --> 01:09:34,848
<i>Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!</i>

905
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:36,929
<i>I have to sever it!</i>

906
01:09:37,429 --> 01:09:40,759
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

907
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:45,488
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

908
01:09:45,518 --> 01:09:48,228
Sounds good! Great idea!

909
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:49,738
I can praise you for that!

910
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,908
Thanks!

911
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:53,828
Let's go!

912
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,198
DREAM

913
01:10:01,748 --> 01:10:05,947
<i>Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.</i>

914
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:07,457
<i>A Blood Demon Art!</i>

915
01:10:08,427 --> 01:10:11,128
He got me!
He's putting me to sleep!

916
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:15,488
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

917
01:10:15,518 --> 01:10:16,878
Then, you'll wake up!

918
01:10:21,678 --> 01:10:22,708
<i>It's all right!</i>

919
01:10:23,048 --> 01:10:25,108
<i>Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!</i>

920
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:31,107
<i>Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!</i>

921
01:10:32,317 --> 01:10:34,317
<i>Okay, I'm awake!</i>

922
01:10:40,317 --> 01:10:44,828
<i>Damn! Even though I'm awake,
I can't avoid looking at the eyes!</i>

923
01:10:45,128 --> 01:10:47,638
<i>I have to wake up with my eyes shut!</i>

924
01:10:47,668 --> 01:10:49,457
<i>With my eyes shut!</i>

925
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:52,247
<i>No good!</i>

926
01:10:52,577 --> 01:10:53,577
<i>Wake up!</i>

927
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:55,327
<i>Wake up!</i>

928
01:10:55,577 --> 01:10:56,327
<i>Hurry!</i>

929
01:10:56,747 --> 01:10:57,827
<i>Cut the neck!</i>

930
01:10:58,217 --> 01:10:59,847
<i>Cut it! Cut it!</i>

931
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:01,927
<i>I have to wake up!</i>

932
01:11:03,897 --> 01:11:05,097
Hurry!

933
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:07,927
<i>Wake up!</i>

934
01:11:11,816 --> 01:11:13,756
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

935
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:15,996
Don't fall for his trap!

936
01:11:16,326 --> 01:11:18,527
Don't die such lame deaths!

937
01:11:22,867 --> 01:11:26,027
I'm wearing the hide
of the mountain god on my head.

938
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:29,197
I bet he's too scared
to look me in the eye!

939
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:32,327
You loser eyeballs!

940
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:37,376
<i>I see. He's having a hard time
telling which way Inosuke's looking!</i>

941
01:11:37,676 --> 01:11:41,456
All right, now all we gotta do
is slash this thing to death!

942
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:46,876
Inosuke!

943
01:11:47,216 --> 01:11:50,277
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

944
01:11:57,316 --> 01:11:58,786
Did you get stabbed?

945
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,196
I'm okay.

946
01:12:02,446 --> 01:12:04,646
Just forget about that bastard!

947
01:12:04,976 --> 01:12:07,146
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

948
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:11,996
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

949
01:12:12,326 --> 01:12:14,456
I know! Let's get moving!

950
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:32,646
Inosuke!

951
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,786
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

952
01:12:34,816 --> 01:12:36,676
And let's chop off the demon's head!

953
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:38,556
Let's attack together!

954
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:16,525
<i>No good! If I fall asleep now...</i>

955
01:13:16,815 --> 01:13:18,025
Damn you!

956
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:20,525
C'mon! Follow me!

957
01:13:20,865 --> 01:13:23,525
<i>Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...</i>

958
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:28,224
<i>Slice 'n' Dice!</i>

959
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,575
<i>Father, please protect me!</i>

960
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:38,155
<i>I'm going to sever that bone...</i>

961
01:13:39,075 --> 01:13:40,205
<i>with this blow!</i>

962
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:42,325
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

963
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:45,995
<i>Clear Blue Sky!</i>

964
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:09,604
Because of its screams and tremors,

965
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:10,834
the train's turning over!

966
01:14:11,024 --> 01:14:12,444
Are you okay, Inosuke?

967
01:14:12,664 --> 01:14:15,334
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

968
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:16,664
Y-Yeah!

969
01:14:16,694 --> 01:14:19,324
Inosuke, protect the passen―

970
01:14:21,244 --> 01:14:22,404
<i>I can't die.</i>

971
01:14:23,194 --> 01:14:26,954
<i>If I die, that'll make him a murderer!</i>

972
01:14:27,264 --> 01:14:28,374
<i>I can't die!</i>

973
01:14:31,264 --> 01:14:33,173
<i>I don't want to let anyone die!</i>

974
01:15:00,073 --> 01:15:02,373
Are you okay, Santaro?

975
01:15:04,493 --> 01:15:06,343
Hang in there!

976
01:15:06,373 --> 01:15:09,323
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

977
01:15:09,663 --> 01:15:11,244
Cool, huh?

978
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:13,154
Is your belly okay?

979
01:15:13,414 --> 01:15:15,204
Your belly that got stabbed!

980
01:15:15,564 --> 01:15:16,553
I'm...

981
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:18,503
all right.

982
01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:20,253
What about you?

983
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:23,673
Never felt better!
I didn't even catch a cold!

984
01:15:24,313 --> 01:15:27,253
I won't be able to move for a while.

985
01:15:28,513 --> 01:15:31,173
Help the others, will you?

986
01:15:32,523 --> 01:15:34,603
Was anyone injured?

987
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:39,242
What about the engineer near the head?

988
01:15:41,572 --> 01:15:43,742
It's okay if that bastard dies!

989
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:46,163
It's not okay.

990
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:48,793
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

991
01:15:48,823 --> 01:15:52,253
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

992
01:15:52,543 --> 01:15:54,933
His leg's shattered,
and he can't walk anymore!

993
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:56,423
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

994
01:15:56,843 --> 01:16:00,543
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

995
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:03,002
Help him, will you?

996
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:06,252
Please.

997
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:15,162
I'll go for you, then!

998
01:16:15,192 --> 01:16:16,852
Because I'm the boss!

999
01:16:17,192 --> 01:16:19,103
Because my minion asked me to!

1000
01:16:19,393 --> 01:16:23,522
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

1001
01:16:24,272 --> 01:16:27,452
That's really not necessary.

1002
01:16:31,912 --> 01:16:34,042
<i>It's almost dawn.</i>

1003
01:16:35,572 --> 01:16:37,452
<i>Get your breathing under control.</i>

1004
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:39,702
<i>We have to...</i>

1005
01:16:40,322 --> 01:16:41,722
<i>save the injured...</i>

1006
01:16:42,342 --> 01:16:43,842
<i>before it's too late.</i>

1007
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:46,921
<i>Nezuko...</i>

1008
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:48,541
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

1009
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,331
<i>Rengoku...</i>

1010
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:53,872
</i>I'm sure they're all safe!<i></i>

1011
01:16:54,332 --> 01:16:55,872
<i>You have to believe!</i>

1012
01:17:02,612 --> 01:17:04,572
<i>My body's disintegrating.</i>

1013
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,692
<i>I can't regenerate,</i>

1014
01:17:07,662 --> 01:17:10,771
<i>Did I lose? Am I going to die?</i>

1015
01:17:11,111 --> 01:17:11,951
<i>Me?</i>

1016
01:17:12,611 --> 01:17:13,571
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

1017
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:17,591
<i>Ridiculous!
I haven't been able to go all out!</i>

1018
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:21,061
<i>I couldn't devour a single human!</i>

1019
01:17:21,091 --> 01:17:26,592
<i>My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!</i>

1020
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,592
<i>And now, look what I've been reduced to!</i>

1021
01:17:29,842 --> 01:17:33,141
<i>After all the time and trouble I've taken!</i>

1022
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,101
<i>It was him!</i>

1023
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:37,221
<i>It's all his fault!</i>

1024
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:43,031
<i>Even though I'd taken
200 humans hostage, still I struggled!</i>

1025
01:17:43,061 --> 01:17:44,521
<i>I was held at bay!</i>

1026
01:17:44,941 --> 01:17:47,351
<i>Is this the power of a Hashira?</i>

1027
01:17:47,771 --> 01:17:50,701
<i>And him... He was fast, too.</i>

1028
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:54,130
<i>Even though he never broke
the spell completely!</i>

1029
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:58,681
<i>Not to mention that girl!
She's a demon! What's that about?</i>

1030
01:17:58,711 --> 01:18:01,041
<i>A demon, joining forces
with Demon Slayers?</i>

1031
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:04,371
<i>Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?</i>

1032
01:18:05,741 --> 01:18:08,391
<i>Dammit! Dammit!</i>

1033
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:10,171
<i>In the first place...</i>

1034
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:14,920
<i>it all started going downhill
once that brat broke my spell!</i>

1035
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,640
<i>That brat is to blame!</i>

1036
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:21,500
<i>I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!</i>

1037
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,420
<i>That's right, and that boar, too!</i>

1038
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:28,240
<i>I could've at least killed that brat!</i>

1039
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:32,461
<i>But that boar thwarted me.
His intuition is extraordinary,</i>

1040
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:34,691
<i>He could sense my gaze!</i>

1041
01:18:36,241 --> 01:18:37,770
<i>Am I going to lose?</i>

1042
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:40,070
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

1043
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:45,450
<i>Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!</i>

1044
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:51,450
<i>It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.</i>

1045
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,090
<i>In the Upper Ranks...</i>

1046
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,810
<i>the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.</i>

1047
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,799
<i>They're strong enough to defeat Hashira
who've killed an untold number of demons.</i>

1048
01:19:02,139 --> 01:19:04,799
<i>Do they have otherworldly powers?</i>

1049
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:10,690
<i>Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!</i>

1050
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:15,840
<i>I want to do it over!
I want to do it over!</i>

1051
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:21,540
<i>What a miserable nightmare this is...</i>

1052
01:19:28,819 --> 01:19:31,369
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1053
01:19:31,709 --> 01:19:33,339
Impressive!

1054
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,999
Rengoku...

1055
01:19:36,589 --> 01:19:39,440
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1056
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:42,840
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1057
01:19:44,089 --> 01:19:45,499
I'll do my best.

1058
01:19:46,559 --> 01:19:48,389
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1059
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:52,189
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1060
01:19:52,519 --> 01:19:55,689
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1061
01:19:56,409 --> 01:19:57,689
There's a blood vessel.

1062
01:19:58,109 --> 01:19:59,739
A torn blood vessel.

1063
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:05,069
Concentrate harder!

1064
01:20:16,499 --> 01:20:20,119
That's it. Stanch it.
Stop the bleeding.

1065
01:20:25,469 --> 01:20:26,799
Focus!

1066
01:20:36,388 --> 01:20:38,798
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1067
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:42,738
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1068
01:20:43,408 --> 01:20:45,399
Not that you'll be able to do everything,

1069
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:49,819
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1070
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:52,568
Right.

1071
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,718
Everyone's safe!

1072
01:20:56,058 --> 01:20:58,918
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1073
01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:03,748
Don't strain yourself.
Take it easy and rest up.

1074
01:21:08,168 --> 01:21:09,668
Thank you very much.

1075
01:21:35,497 --> 01:21:37,327
UPPER THREE

1076
01:21:39,287 --> 01:21:41,947
<i>Upper... Three?</i>

1077
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,667
<i>What's he doing here and now?</i>

1078
01:21:57,638 --> 01:21:59,597
<i>Flame Breathing, Second Form...</i>

1079
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:03,517
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

1080
01:22:13,707 --> 01:22:15,367
That's a fine sword.

1081
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:19,147
<i>He sure can regenerate fast.</i>

1082
01:22:19,537 --> 01:22:21,866
<i>This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...</i>

1083
01:22:22,286 --> 01:22:23,616
<i>So, this is an Upper Rank,</i>

1084
01:22:24,466 --> 01:22:28,167
I can't understand why you'd go
after a wounded person first.

1085
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:33,497
He could get in the way
of the chitchat... of you and me.

1086
01:22:33,807 --> 01:22:36,087
What would you and I have to talk about?

1087
01:22:36,417 --> 01:22:40,497
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1088
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:44,896
Is that right?
Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1089
01:22:45,236 --> 01:22:47,846
The sight of a weakling
makes my skin crawl.

1090
01:22:48,406 --> 01:22:52,436
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1091
01:22:53,906 --> 01:22:56,686
All right, then I have
a brilliant proposal for you.

1092
01:22:57,016 --> 01:22:59,537
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1093
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:01,037
I will not.

1094
01:23:01,707 --> 01:23:04,836
I can tell your strength at a glance.

1095
01:23:04,866 --> 01:23:06,496
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1096
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:09,286
Your fighting spirit
has been honed to the hilt.

1097
01:23:09,616 --> 01:23:11,946
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1098
01:23:12,336 --> 01:23:16,136
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1099
01:23:16,686 --> 01:23:18,596
I'm Akaza.

1100
01:23:18,936 --> 01:23:19,936
Kyojuro...

1101
01:23:20,386 --> 01:23:25,096
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1102
01:23:25,436 --> 01:23:26,936
Because you're a human.

1103
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:30,215
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1104
01:23:31,935 --> 01:23:34,366
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1105
01:23:35,206 --> 01:23:39,756
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1106
01:23:39,786 --> 01:23:41,366
You can become stronger.

1107
01:23:42,956 --> 01:23:47,866
<i>Of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!</i>

1108
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:50,135
<i>I have to help him fight!</i>

1109
01:23:51,165 --> 01:23:57,585
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1110
01:23:57,885 --> 01:24:01,105
The fact that we grow old and die

1111
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:04,635
is what makes human life
so unbearably precious and noble.

1112
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:10,736
"Strength" isn't a word
used to describe just the body.

1113
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:16,895
This boy isn't weak!

1114
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:20,015
Don't insult him.

1115
01:24:20,315 --> 01:24:22,035
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1116
01:24:22,065 --> 01:24:25,335
You and I have different senses of value.

1117
01:24:26,005 --> 01:24:29,915
No matter what the reason,
I will not become a demon!

1118
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:36,414
I see.

1119
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,195
<i>Technique Development...</i>

1120
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:44,265
<i>Destructive Death: Compass Needle!</i>

1121
01:24:59,204 --> 01:25:01,784
If you refuse to become a demon,
I'll kill you

1122
01:25:15,835 --> 01:25:18,475
<i>I can't follow their movements!</i>

1123
01:25:18,504 --> 01:25:22,414
There were never any Flames
among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1124
01:25:23,134 --> 01:25:26,164
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1125
01:25:30,654 --> 01:25:32,474
Why do you think that is?

1126
01:25:32,504 --> 01:25:36,814
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1127
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:40,734
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1128
01:25:45,853 --> 01:25:50,084
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1129
01:25:50,114 --> 01:25:52,444
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1130
01:25:53,254 --> 01:25:55,194
Die, Kyojuro...

1131
01:25:55,454 --> 01:25:57,284
while you're still young and strong.

1132
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,194
<i>Destructive Death..</i>

1133
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:03,783
<i>Air Type!</i>

1134
01:26:17,103 --> 01:26:18,043
I see.

1135
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,094
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

1136
01:26:22,304 --> 01:26:23,574
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

1137
01:26:23,604 --> 01:26:25,693
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

1138
01:26:27,903 --> 01:26:31,033
<i>When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!</i>

1139
01:26:34,283 --> 01:26:36,563
<i>He can move
faster than the blink of an eye.</i>

1140
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:47,433
<i>If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.</i>

1141
01:26:47,463 --> 01:26:48,712
<i>In that case...</i>

1142
01:26:54,133 --> 01:26:55,413
<i>I'll just have to get up close!</i>

1143
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:59,063
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1144
01:27:01,903 --> 01:27:05,013
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1145
01:27:05,313 --> 01:27:06,573
Kyojuro!

1146
01:27:06,603 --> 01:27:08,093
Doesn't that make you sad?

1147
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:09,513
It happens to everyone!

1148
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:11,982
It's a fact of life for any human!

1149
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,982
Stay where you are!

1150
01:27:15,252 --> 01:27:17,282
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1151
01:27:17,702 --> 01:27:18,862
Stand back! That's an order!

1152
01:27:20,082 --> 01:27:22,242
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1153
01:27:22,662 --> 01:27:24,112
Come on, give me your best shot!

1154
01:27:27,453 --> 01:27:29,113
Concentrate on me.

1155
01:27:41,432 --> 01:27:42,882
Nice moves!

1156
01:27:49,052 --> 01:27:50,332
Rengoku!

1157
01:27:50,362 --> 01:27:51,732
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1158
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:57,981
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1159
01:28:01,782 --> 01:28:06,112
Fight me forever
and get stronger together with me.

1160
01:28:10,002 --> 01:28:12,462
You have what it takes to do that!

1161
01:28:14,382 --> 01:28:15,712
I'll pass!

1162
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:19,411
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1163
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:25,181
I will not become a demon!

1164
01:28:25,661 --> 01:28:26,661
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

1165
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:29,821
<i>Third Form...</i>

1166
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:32,091
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

1167
01:28:35,102 --> 01:28:37,012
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1168
01:28:38,852 --> 01:28:40,031
<i>Destructive Death..</i>

1169
01:28:40,061 --> 01:28:41,161
<i>Air Type!</i>

1170
01:28:49,661 --> 01:28:51,111
<i>There's no opening.</i>

1171
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,611
<i>I can't jump in.</i>

1172
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:55,471
<i>I can't keep up
with the speed of their movements!</i>

1173
01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:58,261
<i>Those two are in a different dimension!</i>

1174
01:28:58,511 --> 01:29:02,630
<i>Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!</i>

1175
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,630
<i>I can't move...</i>

1176
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,541
<i>because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!</i>

1177
01:29:11,381 --> 01:29:13,011
Rengoku...

1178
01:29:17,361 --> 01:29:19,061
You still don't get it?

1179
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:24,730
That if you continue attacking,
you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1180
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,790
<i>Flame Breathing, First Form...</i>

1181
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,080
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

1182
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:41,711
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1183
01:29:42,081 --> 01:29:44,411
You haven't reached
your physical peak yet!

1184
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,390
<i>Second Form...</i>

1185
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,430
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

1186
01:29:55,910 --> 01:30:00,660
In a year or two, you'll have polished your skills
even more, you'll have greater precision!

1187
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:14,110
<i>Third Form...</i>

1188
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,830
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

1189
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,330
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

1190
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,660
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

1191
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,790
<i>Destructive Death..</i>

1192
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:27,380
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

1193
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,090
<i>Flame Tiger!</i>

1194
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:34,179
<i>Disorder!</i>

1195
01:30:38,049 --> 01:30:39,789
Kyojuro!

1196
01:30:56,479 --> 01:30:58,909
Did he do it? Did he win?

1197
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:28,979
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

1198
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:37,029
<i>No way!</i>

1199
01:31:44,578 --> 01:31:47,028
Let's fight more.

1200
01:31:47,828 --> 01:31:50,208
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1201
01:32:06,278 --> 01:32:07,698
<i>Rengoku...</i>

1202
01:32:08,528 --> 01:32:09,978
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1203
01:32:12,358 --> 01:32:13,888
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1204
01:32:18,778 --> 01:32:25,127
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1205
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:32,578
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1206
01:32:32,828 --> 01:32:34,878
But what about you?

1207
01:32:34,908 --> 01:32:39,848
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs
and damaged internal organs...

1208
01:32:39,878 --> 01:32:42,088
All irreparable.

1209
01:32:42,398 --> 01:32:45,227
If you were a demon
you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1210
01:32:45,557 --> 01:32:48,977
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1211
01:32:49,227 --> 01:32:53,177
You can struggle all you want, but
a human can never beat a demon.

1212
01:32:55,597 --> 01:32:57,677
<i>I want to go help him!</i>

1213
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:02,858
<i>But there's no strength in my arms or legs.</i>

1214
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:05,248
<i>It's partly because of my injury,</i>

1215
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:08,327
<i>but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!</i>

1216
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:24,037
Kyojuro, why...

1217
01:33:28,457 --> 01:33:31,036
I will fulfill my duty!

1218
01:33:31,296 --> 01:33:34,686
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1219
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,527
<i>I'll damage his body
as much as I can in an instant!</i>

1220
01:33:39,777 --> 01:33:40,937
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

1221
01:33:41,527 --> 01:33:42,777
<i>Esoteric Art!</i>

1222
01:33:48,727 --> 01:33:51,097
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1223
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:54,016
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1224
01:33:54,046 --> 01:33:56,036
That mental strength!

1225
01:33:56,296 --> 01:33:59,036
That airtight stance!

1226
01:34:01,406 --> 01:34:05,036
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1227
01:34:05,296 --> 01:34:08,307
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1228
01:34:08,647 --> 01:34:10,137
<i>Set your heart ablaze.</i>

1229
01:34:11,147 --> 01:34:12,887
<i>Go beyond your limits!</i>

1230
01:34:14,116 --> 01:34:16,106
I'm the Flame Hashira...

1231
01:34:16,446 --> 01:34:18,156
Kyojuro Rengoku!

1232
01:34:18,846 --> 01:34:20,056
Ninth Form...

1233
01:34:20,806 --> 01:34:22,506
Rengoku!

1234
01:34:22,756 --> 01:34:24,026
<i>Destructive Death..</i>

1235
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:25,656
<i>Annihilation Type!</i>

1236
01:34:42,706 --> 01:34:44,036
Rengoku!

1237
01:35:17,296 --> 01:35:18,456
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1238
01:35:23,705 --> 01:35:25,205
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1239
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:28,875
I see hi―

1240
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:29,955
Ren...

1241
01:35:30,295 --> 01:35:31,325
goku...

1242
01:35:42,115 --> 01:35:45,564
You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro!

1243
01:35:45,754 --> 01:35:47,274
Become a demon!

1244
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:49,275
Say that you'll become a demon!

1245
01:35:49,305 --> 01:35:50,575
You are...

1246
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:53,935
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1247
01:36:06,924 --> 01:36:08,064
Kyojuro...

1248
01:36:08,094 --> 01:36:09,834
Yes, Mother?

1249
01:36:10,874 --> 01:36:12,874
I want you to think hard...

1250
01:36:13,204 --> 01:36:15,504
about what I'm about to ask you.

1251
01:36:16,204 --> 01:36:21,454
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1252
01:36:25,445 --> 01:36:26,725
I don't know!

1253
01:36:27,475 --> 01:36:30,224
So that you can save weaker people.

1254
01:36:31,694 --> 01:36:36,774
Those who were born
blessed with more gifts than others

1255
01:36:36,804 --> 01:36:42,734
are obligated to use those gifts
for the world and other people.

1256
01:36:43,624 --> 01:36:51,483
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1257
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:57,704
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1258
01:36:58,424 --> 01:37:02,724
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1259
01:37:03,304 --> 01:37:07,194
Make sure you never forget that.

1260
01:37:07,224 --> 01:37:08,754
I won't!

1261
01:37:25,353 --> 01:37:29,324
I don't have much more time to live.

1262
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:35,033
I was blessed to be the mother
of such a strong and gentle child.

1263
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:38,873
I will entrust everything to you.

1264
01:37:52,023 --> 01:37:53,183
<i>Mother...</i>

1265
01:37:53,523 --> 01:37:58,602
<i>It was an honor for me
to have been born to such a person as you!</i>

1266
01:38:06,623 --> 01:38:07,733
<i>He stopped it?</i>

1267
01:38:08,153 --> 01:38:10,513
<i>What unbelievable strength!</i>

1268
01:38:10,543 --> 01:38:13,733
<i>I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!</i>

1269
01:38:15,403 --> 01:38:16,873
<i>Damn!</i>

1270
01:38:17,153 --> 01:38:18,703
<i>It'll be daybreak soon!</i>

1271
01:38:19,372 --> 01:38:22,032
<i>I have to kill him and get out of here!</i>

1272
01:38:23,322 --> 01:38:24,312
<i>I can't...</i>

1273
01:38:24,342 --> 01:38:25,632
<i>pull my arm out!</i>

1274
01:38:27,972 --> 01:38:30,082
<i>I won't let you escape!</i>

1275
01:38:36,973 --> 01:38:40,173
<i>No matter what Rengoku says...</i>

1276
01:38:41,742 --> 01:38:42,902
<i>I have to...</i>

1277
01:38:43,242 --> 01:38:44,602
<i>do it right now!</i>

1278
01:38:45,442 --> 01:38:48,572
<i>I have to slice off the demon's head!</i>

1279
01:38:48,902 --> 01:38:50,102
<i>Quickly!</i>

1280
01:38:52,902 --> 01:38:54,652
<i>The sun's coming up!</i>

1281
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:57,402
<i>There'll be sunlight here!</i>

1282
01:38:57,742 --> 01:39:00,922
<i>I have to get away!</i>

1283
01:39:10,312 --> 01:39:12,392
<i>No way am I ever letting go!</i>

1284
01:39:12,422 --> 01:39:15,432
<i>Not until I chop off your head!</i>

1285
01:39:18,402 --> 01:39:20,602
Out of my way!

1286
01:39:25,102 --> 01:39:27,021
Move, Inosuke!

1287
01:39:27,721 --> 01:39:30,681
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1288
01:39:34,151 --> 01:39:36,781
<i>Beast Breathing, Fang One...</i>

1289
01:39:37,241 --> 01:39:38,821
<i>Pierce!</i>

1290
01:39:57,221 --> 01:40:00,331
<i>I have to find refuge from the sunlight!</i>

1291
01:40:10,521 --> 01:40:12,070
<i>That took too long!</i>

1292
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,270
<i>I have to get away from the sun!</i>

1293
01:40:21,351 --> 01:40:22,981
Don't run away!

1294
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:25,391
Don't run away, you coward!

1295
01:40:25,421 --> 01:40:27,531
Don't run away!

1296
01:40:29,871 --> 01:40:33,140
<i>What the hell is that brat talking about?</i>

1297
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:35,760
<i>Doesn't he have a brain in his head?</i>

1298
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:38,450
<i>I'm not running away from you!</i>

1299
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:41,020
<i>I'm running away from the sun!</i>

1300
01:40:41,050 --> 01:40:44,300
<i>And besides,
the battle's already been decided!</i>

1301
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,970
<i>He'll run out of strength and die soon!</i>

1302
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:52,221
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1303
01:40:52,601 --> 01:40:56,760
is always fighting you demons in the dark
of the night where you have the advantage!

1304
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:58,900
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1305
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,320
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1306
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:04,150
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1307
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:06,980
Don't run away, you bastard!

1308
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,670
You bastard!

1309
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:10,730
You coward!

1310
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:15,310
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1311
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:17,050
He's stronger!

1312
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,969
Rengoku didn't lose!

1313
01:41:19,219 --> 01:41:21,219
He didn't let anybody die!

1314
01:41:21,249 --> 01:41:24,860
He fought to the end!
He protected them to the end!

1315
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:26,970
You're the one who lost!

1316
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,830
It's Rengoku who won!

1317
01:42:05,499 --> 01:42:07,769
Stop yelling already.

1318
01:42:13,549 --> 01:42:15,429
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1319
01:42:16,099 --> 01:42:18,129
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1320
01:42:19,349 --> 01:42:21,519
If you die, young Kamado,

1321
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,149
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1322
01:42:26,118 --> 01:42:27,618
Rengoku...

1323
01:42:28,898 --> 01:42:30,319
Come over here.

1324
01:42:30,739 --> 01:42:33,149
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1325
01:42:51,168 --> 01:42:53,168
There's something that I remembered...

1326
01:42:54,718 --> 01:42:57,048
while I was dreaming.

1327
01:42:58,188 --> 01:42:59,898
You should go to my parents' home,

1328
01:43:00,518 --> 01:43:03,148
the Rengoku residence.

1329
01:43:04,099 --> 01:43:07,599
There should be some notes there
left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1330
01:43:09,398 --> 01:43:11,568
My father read them often,

1331
01:43:12,438 --> 01:43:16,028
but since I never did,
I don't know what's in them.

1332
01:43:17,998 --> 01:43:25,998
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1333
01:43:27,418 --> 01:43:30,968
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1334
01:43:30,998 --> 01:43:33,357
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1335
01:43:33,387 --> 01:43:35,677
Isn't there a way
to close up your wounds?

1336
01:43:36,417 --> 01:43:37,608
No.

1337
01:43:37,638 --> 01:43:40,298
I'll be dead soon.

1338
01:43:42,268 --> 01:43:45,968
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1339
01:43:47,798 --> 01:43:49,978
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1340
01:43:50,738 --> 01:43:52,648
to follow his heart...

1341
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:57,397
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1342
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:01,397
Tell my father...

1343
01:44:02,287 --> 01:44:04,947
that I want him to take care of himself.

1344
01:44:07,087 --> 01:44:08,217
One more thing.

1345
01:44:09,387 --> 01:44:10,498
Young Kamado...

1346
01:44:13,088 --> 01:44:15,498
I believe in your little sister.

1347
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:19,047
I accept her as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1348
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:26,727
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1349
01:44:27,737 --> 01:44:31,517
Anyone who risks their lives
fighting demons to protect humans...

1350
01:44:31,897 --> 01:44:35,647
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1351
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:38,726
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1352
01:44:43,746 --> 01:44:49,247
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1353
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:52,327
set your heart ablaze.

1354
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:57,747
Grit your teeth
and look straight ahead.

1355
01:44:59,217 --> 01:45:02,266
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1356
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:05,236
the time won't wait for you...

1357
01:45:05,266 --> 01:45:09,216
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1358
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:13,516
Don't feel bad
that I'm going to die here.

1359
01:45:14,136 --> 01:45:15,566
As a Hashira,

1360
01:45:15,896 --> 01:45:18,777
of course I would shield my juniors.

1361
01:45:19,317 --> 01:45:23,316
Any other Hashira
would've done the same thing.

1362
01:45:24,146 --> 01:45:26,276
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1363
01:45:27,586 --> 01:45:28,896
Young Kamado...

1364
01:45:30,566 --> 01:45:32,166
Young Boar Head...

1365
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,466
Yellow Boy...

1366
01:45:36,086 --> 01:45:38,076
Keep learning and grow.

1367
01:45:38,886 --> 01:45:40,246
And then,

1368
01:45:40,886 --> 01:45:44,246
become the next Hashira
supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1369
01:45:45,745 --> 01:45:47,075
I believe in you.

1370
01:45:48,215 --> 01:45:50,645
I believe in you all.

1371
01:46:16,445 --> 01:46:17,865
<i>Mother...</i>

1372
01:46:22,495 --> 01:46:24,716
<i>Do you think I did it right?</i>

1373
01:46:27,016 --> 01:46:30,515
<i>Did I carry out what I had to do...</i>

1374
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:32,925
<i>and my duties?</i>

1375
01:46:42,315 --> 01:46:44,725
<i>You made me proud.</i>

1376
01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:23,394
When the train went off the rails,

1377
01:47:23,814 --> 01:47:26,474
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1378
01:47:27,094 --> 01:47:31,395
He must've kept the damage
to the cars to a minimum.

1379
01:47:33,335 --> 01:47:34,945
I guess he did.

1380
01:47:36,445 --> 01:47:38,744
I can't believe he's gone.

1381
01:47:39,364 --> 01:47:42,024
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1382
01:47:42,334 --> 01:47:43,244
Yeah.

1383
01:47:44,084 --> 01:47:46,414
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1384
01:47:47,084 --> 01:47:50,094
Was it that strong? I mean...

1385
01:47:50,514 --> 01:47:51,674
Yeah.

1386
01:47:54,094 --> 01:47:56,264
I'm so frustrated!

1387
01:47:57,594 --> 01:48:00,343
As soon as I master one thing,

1388
01:48:01,293 --> 01:48:05,794
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1389
01:48:07,364 --> 01:48:12,274
while more powerful people
are fighting far beyond it.

1390
01:48:13,144 --> 01:48:15,774
I just can't make it there yet!

1391
01:48:17,144 --> 01:48:20,724
If I'm still stumbling around
in a place like this, can I...

1392
01:48:21,643 --> 01:48:23,043
Can I...

1393
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:30,073
ever become like Rengoku?

1394
01:48:40,334 --> 01:48:42,844
Stop whining already!

1395
01:48:44,593 --> 01:48:48,813
Stop saying dumbass things
like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1396
01:48:48,843 --> 01:48:54,063
He said he believes in you, so just think
about how you're going to measure up to that!

1397
01:48:54,093 --> 01:48:57,863
All living things just go back
to the earth when they die!

1398
01:48:58,163 --> 01:49:01,363
Sobbing or sniveling
won't bring them back!

1399
01:49:01,663 --> 01:49:04,113
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1400
01:49:04,463 --> 01:49:07,712
No matter how pathetic
or humiliated you feel,

1401
01:49:07,742 --> 01:49:10,112
you still have to go on living!

1402
01:49:10,362 --> 01:49:11,993
But you're crying, too.

1403
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:15,763
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1404
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:18,763
I'm not crying!

1405
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:32,022
Get over here!
We're gonna train!

1406
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:17,721
Is that so...

1407
01:50:18,091 --> 01:50:20,062
Rengoku...

1408
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:44,711
So, even Rengoku couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1409
01:50:49,881 --> 01:50:51,711
I don't believe it.

1410
01:50:58,691 --> 01:51:00,811
Namu Amida Butsu.

1411
01:51:07,191 --> 01:51:11,811
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1412
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:20,910
I see.

1413
01:51:30,431 --> 01:51:35,271
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?

1414
01:51:35,931 --> 01:51:38,261
Kyojuro did a great job, then.

1415
01:51:38,641 --> 01:51:40,471
What a remarkable child.

1416
01:51:41,891 --> 01:51:43,810
I'm not sad.

1417
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:47,140
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1418
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:53,320
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1419
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,520
in the land of the dead.

1420
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:09,760
Rengoku...

1421
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,840
Rengoku...

1422
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:17,620
Rengoku!
