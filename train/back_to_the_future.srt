00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,965
Announcer: October is inventory time,

2
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,636
so right now, statler Toyota
is making the best deals of the year

3
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,839
on all 1985-model toyotas.

4
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,507
You won't find a better car

5
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,890
at a better price with better service
anywhere in hill valley.

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,267
That's statler Toyota
in downtown hill valley.

7
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,228
Newscaster: The senate is expected
to vote on this today.

8
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,487
In other news, officials at
the pacific nuclear research facility

9
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,239
have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium

10
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,572
was in fact stolen
from their vault two weeks ago.

11
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,586
A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.

12
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:13,042
However, officials now attribute
the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,293
The FBI, which is investigating the matter,
had no comment.

14
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,381
Marty: Hey, doc?

15
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,089
Doc?

16
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,008
Hello! Anybody home?

17
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,387
Einstein, come here, boy.

18
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,018
What's going on? Oh, god.

19
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,815
Oh, Jesus!

20
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,687
That is disgusting. Where the hell is he?

21
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,939
Whoa!

22
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,314
Rock 'n' roll.

23
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,082
- Yo.
- Doc: Marty, is that you?

24
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,457
- Hey. Hey, doc. Where are you?
- Thank god I've found you.

25
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,959
Listen, can you meet me
at twin pines mall tonight at 1:15?

26
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,861
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

27
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,171
- Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?
- Yeah.

28
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,923
Doc, what's going on?

29
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,970
- Where you been all week?
- Working.

30
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,221
- Where's Einstein? Is he with you?
- Yeah, he's right here.

31
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,927
You know, doc,
you left your equipment on all week.

32
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,604
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

33
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,525
You better not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.

34
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,978
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

35
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,485
Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.

36
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,361
1:15 A.M., twin pines mall.

37
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,487
Right.

38
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,746
- Are those my clocks I hear?
- Yeah, it's 8:00.

39
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,917
Perfect! My experiment worked!
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

40
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,920
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, doc.

41
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,882
- Are you telling me that it's 8:257
- Precisely.

42
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,347
Damn! I'm late for school.

43
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,155
- Jennifer.
- Marty, don't go this way.

44
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,311
Strickland's looking for you.

45
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,667
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

46
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,958
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

47
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,589
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

48
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,919
Doc?

49
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,381
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett brown, mcfly?

50
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,976
Tardy slip for you, miss Parker.

51
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,348
And one for you, mcfly.
I believe that makes four in a row.

52
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,400
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

53
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,650
This so-called Dr. brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

54
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,152
You hang around with him,
you're gonna end up in big trouble.

55
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,527
Ooh. Yes, sir.

56
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,828
You got a real attitude problem, mcfly.
You're a slacker.

57
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:41,200
You remind me of your father
when he went here. He was a slacker, too.

58
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,376
Can I go now, Mr. strickland?

59
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,206
I noticed your band is on the roster
for the dance auditions after school today.

60
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,712
Why even bother, mcfly?
You don't have a chance.

61
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,589
You're too much like your old man.

62
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,719
No mcfly ever amounted to anything
in the history of hill valley.

63
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,847
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

64
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,438
Next, please.

65
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,399
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

66
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,073
All right.

67
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,573
We're the... we're the pinheads.

68
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,739
One, two, three.

69
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,436
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

70
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,600
Hold it, fellas.

71
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,399
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

72
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,690
Next, please.

73
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,198
Bring up the next group, please.

74
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,070
Announcer: Re-elect mayor
"Goldie" Wilson.

75
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,156
Progress is his middle name.

76
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,332
Marty: "Too loud." I can't believe it.

77
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,035
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

78
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,496
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

79
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,003
I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

80
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,881
But you're good, Marty. You're really good,
and this audition tape of yours is great.

81
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,088
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

82
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,952
- It's like doc's always saying.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

83
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,639
"If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything."

84
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,721
That's good advice, Marty.

85
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,307
All right, okay, Jennifer. What if I
send in the tape and they don't like it?

86
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,313
What if they say I'm no good?

87
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,758
What if they say,
"get out of here, kid. You got no future"?

88
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,945
I mean, I just don't think
I can take that kind of rejection.

89
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,026
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

90
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,931
- Come on. He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

91
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,493
At least he's letting you borrow the car
tomorrow night.

92
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,079
Check out that 4x4.

93
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,420
- That is hot.
- Okay. Back her up.

94
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,749
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

95
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,711
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake?

96
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,715
Throw a couple of sleeping
bags in the back.

97
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,017
Lie out underneath the stars.

98
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,936
Stop it. “What?

99
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,390
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

100
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,524
No, get out of town. My mom thinks
I'm going camping with the guys.

101
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,676
Jennifer, my mother would freak out
if she knew I was going up there with you,

102
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,861
and I'd get the standard lecture about

103
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,319
how she never did that kind of stuff
when she was a kid.

104
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,280
I mean, look,
I think the woman was born a nun.

105
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,866
She's just trying to keep you respectable.

106
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,122
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

107
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,419
Terrible.

108
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,169
Save the clock tower. Save the clock tower.

109
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,299
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

110
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,803
Thirty years ago, lightning struck that
clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.

111
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,179
We at the hill valley preservation society

112
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,683
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

113
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,513
as part of our history and heritage.

114
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,769
- There you go, lady. There's a quarter.
- Thank you.

115
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,977
- Don't forget to take a flyer.
- Right.

116
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,982
Save the clock tower!

117
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,239
Where were we?

118
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,823
Right about here.

119
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,351
Man: Jennifer!

120
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,448
- It's my dad. I've got to go.
- Right.

121
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,205
- I'll call you tonight.
- I'll be at my grandma's.

122
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,708
Here, let me give you the number.

123
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,755
Bye.

124
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,964
Radio dispatcher:
Bravo, tango, delta 6-2-9.

125
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,142
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

126
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,146
Perfect. Just perfect.

127
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,699
I can't believe you'd loan me your car
without telling me it had a blind spot.

128
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,367
- Blind spot?
- I could've been killed.

129
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,078
Now, biff, now, I never noticed

130
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,158
that the car had any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

131
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,663
Hi, son.

132
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,961
Biff: What, are you blind, mcfly?
It's there.

133
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,913
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

134
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,000
George: Biff, can I assume

135
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,465
that your insurance
is going to pay for the damage?

136
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,842
My insurance? It's your car.

137
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,829
Your insurance should pay for it.
I wanna know who's going to pay for this?

138
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,790
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

139
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:53,958
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

140
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:54,982
George: Ah...

141
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,022
Biff: And where's my reports?

142
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,353
Well, I haven't finished those up yet, but
I figured since they weren't due till...

143
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,359
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

144
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,362
- Think, mcfly. Think!
- All right.

145
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,535
I got to have time to get them retyped.

146
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,740
Do you realize what would happen if I
hand in my reports in your handwriting?

147
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,371
I'll get fired.

148
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,248
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

149
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,250
- Would you?
- Of course not, biff.

150
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,798
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

151
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,718
Now, look.
I'll finish those reports on up tonight,

152
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,638
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

153
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,556
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

154
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,883
Mcfly, your shoe's untied.

155
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,978
Oh.

156
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,396
Don't be so gullible, mcfly.
Got the place fixed up nice, though, mcfly.

157
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,730
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

158
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,904
and all you got for me is lite beer?

159
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,913
What are you looking at, butthead?

160
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,954
Say hi to your mom for me.

161
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:05,467
I know what you're going to say, son,
and you're right. You're right.

162
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,550
But biff just happens to be my supervisor,

163
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,267
and I'm afraid I'm just not very good
at confrontations.

164
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,142
But the car, dad.

165
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,604
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

166
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,611
I needed that car tomorrow night, dad.

167
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,859
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

168
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,985
Do you have any clue?

169
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,739
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

170
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,744
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,406
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

172
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,413
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

173
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,746
and headaches of playing at that dance.

174
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,083
David: He's absolutely right, Marty.
The last thing you need is headaches.

175
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,554
Kids, we're going to have
to eat this cake by ourselves.

176
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,514
Your uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

177
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,236
I think it would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

178
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,063
Marty: Uncle "jailbird" Joey?

179
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,614
He's your brother, mom.

180
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,535
Yeah. I think it's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

181
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,821
We all make mistakes in life, children.

182
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,374
- God damn it. I'm late.
- David, watch your mouth!

183
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,043
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go. Come here.

184
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,214
Come on, mom. Make it fast.
I'll miss my bus.

185
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,166
See you later, pop.

186
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,003
Time to change that oil.

187
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,680
Hey, Marty. I'm not your answering service.

188
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,182
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

189
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,514
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

190
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,018
I don't like her, Marty.

191
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,227
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

192
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,188
Oh, mother, there's nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

193
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,775
I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys.

194
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,536
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy

195
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,160
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

196
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,702
Then how am I supposed to
ever meet anybody?

197
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,419
Well, it'll just happen.
Like the way I met your father.

198
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,214
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

199
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,462
It was meant to be.

200
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:20,594
Anyway, if grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

201
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,973
Yeah, well.

202
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,807
I still don't understand what dad was doing
in the middle of the street.

203
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,359
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

204
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,562
What, Lorraine? What?

205
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:35,783
Anyway, your grandpa hit him with the car
and brought him into the house.

206
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,074
He seemed so helpless,

207
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,826
like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

208
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,084
Linda: Yeah, mom, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

209
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,505
You felt sorry for him,

210
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,675
so you decided to go with him
to the fish under the sea dance.

211
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,925
No. It was
the enchantment under the sea dance.

212
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,883
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

213
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,015
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

214
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,605
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

215
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,693
It was then that I realized

216
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,651
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

217
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,726
Hello.

218
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,809
- Doc: Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
- Doc.

219
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,274
No. No, don't be silly.

220
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,615
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

221
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,535
Can you stop by my place
and pick it up on your way to the mall?

222
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,363
Yeah. I'm on my way.

223
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,772
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy?

224
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,029
Doc!

225
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,574
Marty! You made it! Yeah.

226
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,959
Welcome to my latest experiment.
This is the big one,

227
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,911
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

228
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,462
Well, it's a delorean...

229
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,444
Bear with me, Marty.
All your questions will be answered.

230
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,925
- Roll tape and we'll proceed.
- Doc,

231
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,378
- is that a devo suit?
- Never mind that now.

232
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,680
- Not now.
- All right. I'm ready.

233
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,015
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett brown.

234
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,264
I'm standing on the parking lot
at twin pines mall.

235
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,939
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 A.M.

236
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,266
And this is temporal experiment number one.

237
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,775
Come on, einie. Hey, hey, boy, get in
there. That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

238
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,231
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

239
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,408
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

240
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,864
Okay.

241
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,826
Please note that Einstein's clock

242
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,879
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

243
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,502
- Got it?
- Right. Check, doc.

244
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,592
Good.

245
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,720
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

246
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,996
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

247
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,349
- Watch this.
- Yeah. Okay. Got it.

248
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,649
Jesus!

249
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,198
Not me! The car! The car!

250
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,842
If my calculations are correct,

251
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,008
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

252
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,515
you're going to see some serious shit.

253
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,223
Watch this. Watch this.

254
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:15,198
What did I tell you? 88 miles per hour!

255
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:23,210
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 A.M. and zero seconds!

256
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,834
Jesus Christ!

257
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,341
Jesus Christ, doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

258
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,047
Calm down, Marty.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

259
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:36,852
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

260
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,304
Then where the hell are they?

261
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,516
The appropriate question is,
"when the hell are they?"

262
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,070
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

263
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,527
I sent him into the future.

264
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,652
One minute into the future, to be exact.

265
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,954
At precisely 1:21 A.M. and zero seconds,

266
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,908
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

267
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,455
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, doc.

268
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,968
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

269
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,463
- out of a delorean?
- The way I see it,

270
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,346
if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with some style?

271
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,554
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

272
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,643
Look out!

273
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,441
- What? Is it hot?
- It's cold. Damn cold.

274
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,072
Einstein, you little devil!

275
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,829
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

276
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,546
- He's all right.
- He's fine.

277
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,965
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

278
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,634
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

279
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,303
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

280
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,474
He skipped over that minute
to instantly arrive at this moment in time.

281
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,222
- Come here. I'll show you how it works.
- All right.

282
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,974
First, you turn the time circuits on.

283
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,759
This readout tells you where you're going.
This one tells you where you are.

284
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,273
This one tells you where you were.

285
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,654
You input your destination time
on this keypad.

286
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,658
Say you want to see the signing
of the declaration of independence.

287
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,750
Or witness the birth of Christ.

288
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,164
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

289
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,921
November 5th, 1955.

290
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:21,054
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

291
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,636
What? I don't get it. What happened?

292
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,686
That was the day I invented time travel.
I remember it vividly.

293
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,423
I was standing on the edge of my toilet,
hanging a clock.

294
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,208
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

295
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,319
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

296
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,743
a vision, a picture in my head,
a picture of this.

297
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:45,116
This is what makes time travel possible.
The flux capacitor.

298
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,034
Flux capacitor?

299
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,541
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

300
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,043
to realize the vision of that day.

301
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,420
My god, has it been that long?

302
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,928
Things have certainly changed around here.

303
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,975
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

304
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,641
Old man peabody owned all of this.

305
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,479
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

306
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:19,074
This is heavy-duty, doc. This is great.

307
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,073
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

308
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,952
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

309
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,283
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

310
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,744
Are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear?

311
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,830
Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling.
Keep rolling there.

312
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,756
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

313
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,586
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

314
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,264
Doc, you don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

315
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,512
Did you rip that off?

316
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,263
Of course.
From a group of Libyan nationalists.

317
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,627
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

318
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,171
so I took their plutonium and, in turn,
gave them a shoddy bomb casing

319
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,935
full of used pinball machine parts.

320
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,008
- Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

321
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,397
We must prepare to reload.

322
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,020
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

323
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,560
Don't you lose those tapes now.
I need that as a record.

324
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,521
Let's put this back here. There we go.

325
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,654
I almost forgot my luggage.

326
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,486
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

327
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,573
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future?

328
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,063
- That's where you're going?
- That's right, 25 years into the future.

329
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,124
I've always dreamed of seeing the future,
looking beyond my years,

330
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,331
seeing the progress of mankind.

331
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,632
Why not?

332
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,507
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 world series.

333
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,005
Doc.

334
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,134
Huh?

335
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,721
Look me up when you get there.

336
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,974
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

337
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,778
I, Dr. Emmett brown,

338
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,233
am about to embark on an historic journey.

339
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:30,281
What am I thinking of?
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.

340
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,912
How did I ever expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

341
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,618
I must be out of my mind.

342
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,252
What is it, einie?

343
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,262
Oh, my god.

344
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,140
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

345
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,438
Run for it, Marty! “Who? Who?

346
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,312
Who do you think? The Libyans!

347
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,104
Holy shit!

348
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,992
I'll draw their fire!

349
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:16,998
Doc, wait!

350
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,683
No!

351
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,478
You bastard!

352
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,619
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

353
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,668
Gol

354
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,882
Come on! Move, damn it!

355
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,635
Jesus!

356
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,240
Holy shit!

357
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,701
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

358
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,873
What is it? What is it, pa?

359
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,881
Looks like an airplane without wings.

360
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,264
That ain't no airplane. Look.

361
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,569
Children!

362
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,995
Listen... whoa.

363
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,884
Hello?

364
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,381
Excuse me.

365
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,052
Sorry about your barn.

366
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,105
It's already mutated into human form!
Shoot it!

367
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,363
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

368
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,739
Boy: Get away!

369
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,078
Man: Hold it.

370
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,039
Boy: Shoot it, pa!

371
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,499
My pine! Why you...

372
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,963
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

373
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,514
All right. All right. Okay, mcfly.
Get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream.

374
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,391
It's just a very intense dream.

375
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,268
- Listen, you got to help me.
- Don't stop, wilbur! Don't!

376
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,322
It can't be.

377
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,746
This is nuts.

378
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,787
Come on.

379
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,081
Perfect.

380
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:50,034
Announcer: Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.

381
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,913
If you believe in progress,
re-elect mayor red Thomas.

382
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,713
Progress is his middle name.
Mayor red Thomas' progress platform

383
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,215
means more jobs, better education,
bigger civic improvements and lower taxes.

384
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,306
On election day,
cast your vote for a proven leader.

385
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,725
Re-elect mayor red Thomas.

386
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,184
This has got to be a dream.

387
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,959
Lou: Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

388
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,787
- What?
- What's with the life preserver?

389
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:47,346
- I just want to use the phone.
- Yeah, it's in the back.

390
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,599
Marty: Brown.

391
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,186
Great. You're alive.

392
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,699
Come on.

393
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:20,712
- Do you know where 1640 riverside...
- Are you going to order something, kid?

394
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,674
Yeah. Give me a tab.

395
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,965
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

396
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,138
Right. Give me a Pepsi free.

397
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,967
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

398
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,269
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

399
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,347
Something without sugar.

400
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,196
Biff: Hey, mcfly.

401
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,905
What do you think you're doing?

402
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,285
Biff.

403
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,031
I'm talking to you, mcfly, you Irish bug!

404
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,118
- Hey, biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?
- You got my homework finished, mcfly?

405
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,462
Well, actually, I figured
since it wasn't due till Monday...

406
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,336
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

407
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,793
Think, mcfly. Think! Okay.

408
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,753
I got to have time to recopy it.

409
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,592
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

410
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,392
I'll get kicked out of school.

411
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,936
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

412
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,974
- Would you?
- Now, of course not, biff.

413
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,980
- No.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

414
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:29,030
- What are you looking at, butthead?
- Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.

415
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,823
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

416
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,196
How about my homework, mcfly?

417
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,201
Okay, biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

418
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,580
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

419
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,582
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Oh, mcfly, your shoe's untied!

420
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,835
- Don't be so gullible, mcfly.
- Okay.

421
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,794
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

422
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,985
- What?
- You're George mcfly.

423
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,903
Yeah. Who are you?

424
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,206
Say! Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

425
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,578
Well, they're bigger than me.

426
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,285
Stand tall, boy.
Have some respect for yourself.

427
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,587
Don't you know,
if you let people walk over you now,

428
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,794
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

429
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,006
Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life in this slop house?

430
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,882
- Lou: Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir!

431
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,464
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I'm going to night school,

432
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,766
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

433
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,718
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

434
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,178
Yeah, I'm...

435
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,222
Mayor!

436
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,897
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

437
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,478
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

438
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,905
You wait and see, Mr. caruthers.
I will be mayor.

439
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,156
I'll be the most powerful man in hill valley,
and I'm going to clean up this town.

440
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,204
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.

441
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,870
Mayor Goldie Wilson.
I like the sound of that.

442
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,807
Hey, dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

443
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,131
He's a peeping Tom.

444
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:02,846
Dad!

445
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,694
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Who are you?

446
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,993
Stella! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

447
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,164
Come on out here!
Help me take him in the house!

448
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,674
Mom? That you?

449
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,758
Lorraine: There, there, now. Just relax.

450
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,430
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

451
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,730
I had a horrible nightmare.

452
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:55,316
I dreamed that I went back in time.
It was terrible.

453
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,689
Well,

454
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,784
you're safe and sound now,
back in good old 1955.

455
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,282
19557

456
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:13,126
- you're my... you're my...
- My name is Lorraine.

457
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,924
Lorraine baines. Yeah.

458
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,716
But you're... you're so...

459
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,302
You're so thin!

460
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,098
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

461
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:37,400
- Where are my pants?
- Over there, on my hope chest.

462
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,899
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

463
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,490
Calvin? Why do you keep calling me Calvin?

464
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,493
Well, that is your name, isn't it?
Calvin klein?

465
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,705
It's written all over your underwear.

466
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,500
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

467
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,550
No, actually, people call me Marty.

468
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,001
Oh.

469
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,050
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

470
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,340
Marty.

471
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,134
Klein.

472
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,110
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No. Fine.

473
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,563
No. Good. Fine. Good.

474
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,784
That's a big bruise you have there.

475
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,829
Stella: Lorraine, are you up there?

476
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:33,956
Oh, my god! It's my mother!
Quick! Put your pants back on!

477
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,008
Stella: So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

478
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,181
- Marty: Excuse me?
- I guessed you're a sailor.

479
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:51,011
- That's why you wear that life preserver.
- Coast guard.

480
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,518
Sam, here's the young man
you hit with your car out there.

481
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,689
He's all right. Thank god.

482
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,046
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

483
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,048
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

484
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,155
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

485
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,233
Now, let's see. You already know Lorraine.

486
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,162
This is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby,

487
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,456
and over there in the playpen
is little baby Joey.

488
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,119
So, you're my uncle Joey.

489
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,372
Better get used to these bars, kid.

490
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:23,585
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.

491
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,468
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we just leave him in there all the time.

492
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,765
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

493
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,344
- Listen, I really ought to...
- Sit here, Marty.

494
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,354
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

495
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,894
Look at it roll.

496
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,025
Now we can watch Jackie gleason
while we eat.

497
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,492
It's our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

498
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,462
Do you have a television?

499
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,415
Well, yeah. You know we have two of them.

500
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,297
Wow! You must be rich.

501
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:09,472
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

502
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:18,310
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

503
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,689
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

504
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,192
What do you mean, you've seen this?
It's brand-new.

505
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,615
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

506
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,361
What's a rerun? You'll find out.

507
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:36,036
You know, Marty, you look so familiar
to me. Do I know your mother?

508
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,497
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

509
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,921
Stella: Oh, then I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.

510
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,374
You can't.

511
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,549
That is, nobody's home.

512
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:50,929
Oh.

513
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,424
Yet.

514
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,057
Oh.

515
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:58,555
Listen, do you know
where riverside drive is?

516
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:02,767
It's on the other end of town.
A block past maple. East end of town.

517
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,821
Wait a minute, a block past maple.
That's John F. Kennedy drive.

518
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,691
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

519
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,070
Lorraine: Mother?

520
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,320
With Marty's parents out of town,

521
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,286
don't you think he ought
to spend the night?

522
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,788
I mean, after all,
dad almost killed him with the car.

523
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,960
That's true, Marty.

524
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:25,290
I think maybe you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

525
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,842
- Gee, I don't know.
- And he can sleep in my room.

526
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,013
I gotta go! I gotta go! Thanks very much.
It was wonderful.

527
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,434
You were all great. See you all later.
Much later.

528
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,439
- He's a very strange young man.
- He's an idiot.

529
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,947
Comes from upbringing.
His parents are probably idiots, too.

530
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,910
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

531
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,072
Doc?

532
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,530
Don't say a word.

533
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,226
I don't wanna know your name.
I don't want to know anything about you.

534
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,990
- Listen, doc...
- Quiet!

535
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,646
- Doc, it's me, Marty.
- Don't tell me anything.

536
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,831
- Doc, you got to help...
- Quiet. Quiet.

537
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,582
I'm going to read your thoughts.

538
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:53,261
Let's see now.
You've come here from a great distance?

539
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,679
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me!

540
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,183
You want me to buy a subscription
to the Saturday evening post.

541
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,852
- No.
- Not a word. Not a word now!

542
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,099
Quiet.

543
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:11,192
Donations. You want me to make a donation
to the coast guard youth auxiliary.

544
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,192
Doc.

545
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,737
I'm from the future.

546
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,029
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

547
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:25,206
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

548
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,170
My god.

549
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,802
Do you know what this means?

550
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:40,808
It means that this damn thing
doesn't work at all!

551
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,806
Doc, you got to help me.
You are the only one

552
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,229
who knows how your time machine works.

553
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:49,150
Time machine?
I haven't invented any time machine.

554
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,483
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

555
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,737
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.

556
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,411
Look at my birthday, for crying out loud!
I haven't even been born yet.

557
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:04,912
And look at this picture.
It's my brother, my sister and me.

558
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,290
Look at her sweatshirt, doc.
"Class of 1984"?

559
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:13,590
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

560
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,502
I'm telling the truth, doc.
You got to believe me.

561
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,679
Then tell me, future boy,

562
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,593
who's President of the United States
in 19857?

563
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,513
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan? The actor?

564
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,646
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

565
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,359
- I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady.
- Whoa. Wait, doc!

566
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,657
And Jack Benny is secretary
of the treasury.

567
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,154
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

568
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,579
I've had enough practical jokes
for one evening. Good night, future boy!

569
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,031
No, wait, doc. Doc.

570
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,912
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

571
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,413
You told me the whole story.

572
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,087
You were standing on your toilet
and you were hanging a clock,

573
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,381
and you fell
and you hit your head on the sink.

574
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,380
That's when you came up
with the idea for the flux capacitor,

575
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,464
which is what makes time travel possible.

576
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:18,736
There's something wrong with the starter,
so I hid it here.

577
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:33,087
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

578
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,381
The flux capacitor.

579
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,524
It works!

580
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,612
It works!

581
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,619
I finally invent something that works!

582
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,490
You bet your ass it works.

583
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:13,456
Somehow we've got to sneak this
back to my laboratory.

584
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,919
Okay, doc, this is it.

585
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,802
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

586
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:25,302
Why, that's me! Look at me! I'm an old man.

587
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,703
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett brown.

588
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,809
I'm standing on the parking lot
at twin pines mall.

589
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,887
Thank god, I've still got my hair.

590
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,972
What's on earth is this thing I'm wearing?

591
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,228
This is a radiation suit.

592
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,059
Radiation suit?

593
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,146
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

594
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,154
This is truly amazing.

595
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,495
A portable television studio.

596
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,324
No wonder your president has to be an
actor. He's gotta look good on television.

597
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,830
Whoa. This is it.
This is the part coming up, doc.

598
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,044
No, no, no, this suckers electrical,

599
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,043
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts...

600
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,920
What did I just say?

601
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,012
This sucker's electrical,

602
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,012
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts...

603
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,435
1.21 gigawatts!

604
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,147
1.21 gigawatts.

605
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,767
Great Scott!

606
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,155
What the hell is a gigawatt?

607
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,243
How could I have been so careless?
1.21 gigawatts!

608
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,037
Tom, how am I going to generate
that kind of power?

609
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,740
It can't be done, can it?

610
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,577
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

611
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,790
I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore,

612
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,626
but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.

613
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:47,054
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

614
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,307
Whoa, whoa.

615
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:52,806
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here.
I got a life in 1985.

616
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,103
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty?

617
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,608
Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me.

618
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:03,984
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, doc. I mean, that says it all.

619
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,824
Doc, you're my only hope.

620
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,828
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source
capable of generating

621
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,328
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

622
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,911
- What did you say?
- A bolt of lightning.

623
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:23,215
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

624
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,085
We do now.

625
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,769
This is it! This is the answer.

626
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,934
It says here that a bolt of lightning

627
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:42,359
is going to strike the clock tower at
precisely 10:04 P.M. next Saturday night!

628
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:49,366
If we could somehow harness this lightning,

629
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,779
channel it into the flux capacitor,

630
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,869
it just might work.

631
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:01,412
Next Saturday night,
we're sending you back to the future!

632
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,319
Okay, all right. Saturday's good.
Saturday's good.

633
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:07,961
I can spend a week in 19585. I can
hang out. You can show me around.

634
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,297
Marty, that is completely out of the
question. You must not leave this house.

635
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,382
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

636
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,059
Anything you do can have
serious repercussions on future events.

637
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,886
Do you understand?

638
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,730
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

639
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,566
Marty,

640
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,444
have you interacted with anybody
else today, besides me?

641
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,359
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

642
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:35,366
Great Scott! Let me see
that photograph again of your brother.

643
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,165
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

644
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,631
Marty: His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

645
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,339
Erased from existence.

646
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,015
Whoa.

647
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,845
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

648
00:55:58,939 --> 00:55:59,939
Doc: Now remember.

649
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,585
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

650
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,920
If they don't meet, they
won't fall in love,

651
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,797
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

652
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,258
That's why your older brother's
disappearing from that photograph.

653
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,774
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you'll be next.

654
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,469
- Marty:: Sounds pretty heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

655
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,778
Which one's your pop?

656
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,289
That's him.

657
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,163
Okay. Okay, you guys.

658
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,039
Very funny. You guys are being real mature.

659
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,999
Maybe you were adopted.

660
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,631
Okay, real mature, guys.

661
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,047
- Okay, pick up my books.
- Mcfly.

662
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,848
That's strickland.

663
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,393
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

664
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,221
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

665
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,399
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

666
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,520
No.

667
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,816
- What did your mother ever see in that kid?
- I don't know, doc.

668
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:54,025
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

669
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,569
Hit me with the car.

670
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,654
That's the Florence nightingale effect.

671
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,082
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

672
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,409
Go to it, kid.

673
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,087
Hey, George, buddy.

674
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,040
I have been looking all over for you.

675
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,093
You remember me,
the guy who saved your life the other day?

676
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,260
Oh.

677
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,348
- Yeah.
- Good.

678
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,423
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

679
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,642
- Lorraine?
- Calvin!

680
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,851
I'd like you to meet
my good friend George mcfly.

681
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,188
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

682
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,824
- How's your head?
- Good. Fine.

683
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:39,745
Oh. I've been so worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

684
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,287
Are you okay? Yeah.

685
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,124
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Come on!

686
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,794
Isn't he a dreamboat?

687
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:55,135
- Doc, she didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

688
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,931
Apparently, your mother is amorously
infatuated with you, instead of your father.

689
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,633
Whoa. Wait a minute, doc.

690
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,390
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me?

691
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,722
- Precisely.
- Whoa. This is heavy.

692
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,399
There's that word again. "Heavy."

693
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,880
Why are things so heavy in the future?

694
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,049
Is there a problem
with the earth's gravitational pull?

695
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,153
- What?
- The only way

696
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,718
we're going to get those two
to successfully mate

697
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,107
is if they're alone together,

698
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,818
so you've got to get
your father and mother to interact

699
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,995
in some sort of social...

700
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,869
- What? You mean like a date?
- Right!

701
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,793
What kind of date”? I don't know.
What do kids do in the '50s?

702
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,667
They're your parents. You must know them.

703
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,921
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

704
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,009
Nothing.

705
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,305
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

706
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:43,805
Of course! The enchantment under the sea
dance! They're supposed to go to this.

707
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,103
- That's where they kiss for the first time.
- All right, kid.

708
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,398
You stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

709
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,601
George, buddy.

710
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,689
Remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

711
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:06,457
- What are you writing?
- Uh... stories.

712
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,832
Science fiction stories about visitors

713
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,540
coming down to earth from other planets.

714
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:20,258
Get out of town!
I didn't know you did anything creative.

715
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,553
- Let me read some.
- Oh. No, no, no, no.

716
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,476
I never let anybody read my stories.

717
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,470
Why not?

718
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:33,313
Well, what if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

719
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,238
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

720
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,241
No. No, not hard at all.

721
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,992
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

722
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,998
She really likes you.

723
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,919
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

724
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,746
to the enchantment under the sea dance.

725
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,001
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

726
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,176
All you got to do is go over there
and ask her.

727
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,258
What? Right here, right now,
in the cafeteria?

728
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:06,968
What if she said no? I don't know
if I could take that kind of a rejection.

729
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:11,684
Besides, I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

730
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,186
Who?

731
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,102
Biff.

732
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,114
- Don't kid around. Come on.
- I'm gonna leave.

733
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,285
Biff: You want it. You know you want it.
You know you want me to give it to you.

734
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,954
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

735
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,951
Maybe you are
and you just don't know it yet.

736
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,876
Get your meat hooks off of me.

737
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:38,458
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks off.

738
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,126
Please.

739
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,054
So what's it to you, butthead?

740
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,424
You know, you been looking for a fight.

741
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:01,401
Since you're new here,
I'm going to cut you a break, today.

742
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,986
So, why don't you make like a tree
and get out of here.

743
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:20,924
George!

744
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,298
Why do you keep following me around?

745
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,179
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,
if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance,

746
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,309
- I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
- But I can't go to the dance.

747
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,514
I'll miss my favorite television program,
science fiction theatre.

748
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:40,194
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine wants
to go with you. Give her a break.

749
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,444
Look, I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance,

750
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,451
and not you or anybody else on this planet

751
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,120
is going to make me change my mind.

752
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,914
Marty: Science fiction theatre.

753
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,533
Who are you?

754
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,165
Marty: Silence, earthling.

755
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,090
My name is Darth Vader.

756
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,598
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet vulcan.

757
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:55,848
Marty!

758
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,266
- Marty! Marty!
- Hey, George, buddy.

759
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,727
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing all day?

760
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:06,734
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

761
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,441
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

762
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,369
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

763
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,491
God! How do you...

764
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,105
What made you change your mind, George?

765
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,041
Last night, Darth Vader came down
from planet vulcan

766
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:26,045
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

767
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,219
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff
to ourselves, okay?

768
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,798
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- All right, okay. There she is, George.

769
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,632
Now just go in there and invite her.

770
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,470
- Okay. But I don't know what to say.
- Just say anything, George.

771
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:41,603
Say whatever's natural,
the first thing that comes into your mind.

772
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,146
Nothing's coming to my mind.

773
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,997
Jesus, George,
it's a wonder I was even born.

774
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,568
- What? What?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

775
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,243
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

776
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,164
Tell her that she is the most beautiful
girl you have ever seen in the world.

777
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,206
Girls like that stuff.

778
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,506
- What are you doing, George?
- I'm writing this down. This is good stuff.

779
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,037
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

780
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,588
- Can you take care of that?
- Right.

781
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,022
Lou, give me a milk.

782
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,771
Chocolate.

783
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:51,050
Lorraine. My density has popped me to you.

784
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,636
What?

785
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,887
Oh.

786
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,387
What I meant to say was...

787
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,561
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

788
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,096
George: Yes.

789
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,313
Yes. I'm George. George mcfly.

790
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,607
I'm your density.

791
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,900
I mean,

792
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,736
your destiny.

793
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,034
Oh.

794
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,157
Hey, mcfly.

795
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,498
I thought I told you never to come in here.

796
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,215
Well, it's going to cost you.

797
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,835
How much money you got on you?

798
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,296
How much do you want, biff?

799
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,105
All right, punk.

800
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,934
- Now I'm going to...
- Whoa, whoa, biff. What's that?

801
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,697
That's Calvin klein.
Oh, my god, he's a dream.

802
01:05:58,872 --> 01:05:59,907
Whoa, whoa.

803
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,410
- Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!
- Hey!

804
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,891
Marty: I'll get it back to you, all right?

805
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,044
Boy: You broke it!

806
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,462
Come back here!

807
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,417
Wow. Look at him go!

808
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,546
Get him!

809
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,065
To the car! Go! Go!

810
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,157
Girl: What's that thing he's on?
Boy: It's a board with wheels.

811
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,829
He's an absolute dream.

812
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,750
Thug 1: Come on, come on!
Thug 2: Look out for the car!

813
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,759
Whoa!

814
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,909
Biff: I'm going to ram him.

815
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,455
All: Shit!

816
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,131
Ooh!

817
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,403
Thanks a lot, kid.

818
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,945
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

819
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:04,027
- Where does he come from?
- Yeah, where does he live?

820
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,331
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

821
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,504
Doc on TV: Oh, my god.

822
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,008
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

823
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,756
Run for it, Marty!

824
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,841
Oh, my god.

825
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,557
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

826
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,013
Run for it, Marty!

827
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,398
Doc?

828
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:38,111
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

829
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,610
Fascinating device, this video unit.

830
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,280
Listen, doc.

831
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,682
You know, there's something
I haven't told you about the night

832
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,058
- we made that tape.
- Please, Marty, don't tell me.

833
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,435
No man should know too much
about his own destiny.

834
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,894
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.

835
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,689
If I know too much about my own future,
I can endanger my own existence.

836
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,045
Just as you've endangered yours.

837
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,920
- You're right.
- Now...

838
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,878
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

839
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,712
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

840
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,139
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

841
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,137
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

842
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:13,930
Okay, now. We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

843
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,856
from the top of the clock tower

844
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:19,231
down, suspending it over the street
between these two lamp posts.

845
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:23,857
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time vehicle
with this big pole and hook,

846
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,909
which runs directly into
the flux capacitor.

847
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,494
At the calculated moment,
you start off from down the street,

848
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:36,828
driving directly toward the cable,
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

849
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,540
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 P.M. this Saturday night,

850
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:44,253
lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable

851
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,588
just as the connecting hook makes contact

852
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:50,301
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

853
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,848
and sending you back to 1985.

854
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,978
All right, now. Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.

855
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,985
I'll simulate the lightning.

856
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,448
Ready.

857
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,331
Set.

858
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,629
Release.

859
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,194
You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence, doc.

860
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:52,325
Don't worry. I'll take care of the
lightning. You take care of your pop.

861
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:56,491
By the way, what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

862
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,827
- I think so.
- What did she say?

863
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:11,597
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

864
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,404
Hi, Cal... Marty.

865
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,319
Mom. Lorraine.

866
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,077
How did you know I was here?

867
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,534
I followed you.

868
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:41,545
Oh. This is my doc...
My uncle, doc brown.

869
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,383
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

870
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:54,974
but I was kind of wondering if you'd ask me

871
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:58,895
to the enchantment under the sea dance
on Saturday.

872
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,775
Wow, you mean...
You mean nobody's asked you?

873
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:08,529
No. Not yet.

874
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,656
- What about George?
- George mcfly?

875
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:20,200
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

876
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:25,205
Well, I think a man should be strong,

877
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,375
so he can stand up for himself

878
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,670
and protect the woman he loves.

879
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:38,760
Don't you?

880
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,353
Yeah.

881
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,807
I still don't understand.

882
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,984
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

883
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,813
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

884
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,569
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

885
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,571
She just doesn't know it yet.

886
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,699
That's why we got to show her
that you, George mcfly, are a fighter.

887
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,750
You're somebody
who's gonna stand up for yourself,

888
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,248
somebody who's gonna protect her.

889
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,543
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight
in my entire life.

890
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,372
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, dad.

891
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,673
Daddy-o.

892
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,046
You're coming to her rescue, right?

893
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:15,130
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?

894
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,805
I'm going to be at the dance.

895
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:20,010
- Right. And where am I going to be?
- You're gonna be in the car with her.

896
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,062
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,
she's going to get very angry with me.

897
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,561
Why is she going to get angry with you?

898
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:30,315
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them.

899
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,566
You mean you're going to go
touch her on her...

900
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,117
No. No, George, look.

901
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,911
It's just an act, right?

902
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:43,699
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

903
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,336
You see us struggling in the car.

904
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,920
You walk up, you open the door,
and you say...

905
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,293
Your line, George.

906
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:56,758
Oh!

907
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,266
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

908
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:05,017
- You really think I ought to swear?
- Yes, definitely.

909
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,722
God damn it, George, swear.

910
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:10,025
Okay. So, now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

911
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,898
I'm out for the count, right?

912
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:15,197
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

913
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:20,074
You make it sound so easy.
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

914
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:24,032
George, there's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is a little self-confidence.

915
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:28,369
You know, if you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

916
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,278
Announcer: Hill valley area weather
this Saturday night.

917
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,294
Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.

918
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,095
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

919
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,093
Are you sure about this storm?

920
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:45,099
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

921
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,271
You know, Marty,
I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

922
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:51,772
You've really made a difference in my life.
You've given me something to shoot for.

923
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:56,026
Just knowing that I'm going to be around
to see 1985.

924
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,028
That I'm going to succeed in this!

925
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,657
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time!

926
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,856
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

927
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,838
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

928
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,507
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

929
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,677
I'm really going to miss you.

930
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,392
- Doc, about the future...
- No!

931
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,349
Marty! We've already agreed

932
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:31,308
that having information about the future
can be extremely dangerous.

933
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,940
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

934
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,567
Whatever you've got to tell me, I'll find
out through the natural course of time.

935
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,576
"Dear Dr. brown.

936
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,788
"On the night that I go back in time,

937
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,991
"you will be

938
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,873
"shot by terrorists.

939
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:57,967
"Please take whatever precautions are
necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.

940
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,136
"Your friend,

941
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,423
"Marty."

942
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,818
Evening, Dr. brown. What's with the wire?

943
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,817
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

944
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,741
- What you got under here?
- No! Don't touch that!

945
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,615
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

946
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:29,290
- You got a permit for that?
- Of course I do.

947
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,834
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

948
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:36,566
Do you mind if we park for a while?

949
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,734
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

950
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,857
Huh?

951
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:45,658
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.

952
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,738
What?

953
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:51,281
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

954
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,490
No.

955
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:54,659
No.

956
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,837
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

957
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:04,635
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

958
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,634
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

959
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,761
- Why not?
- Because you...

960
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:13,303
You might regret it later in life.

961
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:18,269
Marty, don't be such a square.
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

962
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,280
Jeez, you smoke, 100?

963
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,652
Marty, you're beginning
to sound just like my mother.

964
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,795
We're going to take a little break,
but we'll be back in a while,

965
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,468
so don't nobody go nowhere.

966
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:06,151
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

967
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,774
Lorraine.

968
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:13,867
Have you ever been in a situation

969
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,744
where you knew
you had to act a certain way,

970
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,827
but when you got there, you didn't know
if you could go through with it?

971
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:23,380
You mean like
how you're supposed to act on a first date?

972
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,707
Sort of.

973
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,173
I think I know exactly what you mean.

974
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,299
You do?

975
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:33,424
You know what I do in those situations?

976
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,760
- What?
- I don't worry.

977
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,407
This is all wrong. I don't know what it is.

978
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:02,544
But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing

979
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,706
my brother.

980
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,717
I guess that doesn't make any sense,
does it?

981
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,797
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

982
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,346
Somebody's coming.

983
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:24,483
You caused 300 bucks damage to my car,
you son of a bitch.

984
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,858
And I'm going to take it out of your ass.
Hold him.

985
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:31,194
Let him go, biff. You're drunk.

986
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,493
Well, look-ey what we have here.

987
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,909
No, no! You're staying right here with me.
Come on, Lorraine.

988
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,369
- Lorraine: Let me go!
- Leave her alone, you bastard!

989
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,358
Take him in back, all right?
I'll be right there.

990
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,465
Biff: Just admit that you want it. Come on.

991
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,838
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

992
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,185
- Hey, let's put him in there.
- Yeah!

993
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,939
That's for messing up my hair.

994
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,108
What the hell are you doing to my car?

995
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,652
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

996
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,823
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

997
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,948
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

998
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,621
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

999
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,539
Get home to your mama, boy.

1000
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,868
Thug 1: Biff!
Thug 2: Hurry, biff!

1001
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,252
Marty: Let me out of here!

1002
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,793
- Reginald, where are your keys?
- Marty: The keys are in the trunk.

1003
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,299
- Say that again?
- Marty: I said, the keys are in here.

1004
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:50,314
Biff: Come on!

1005
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,150
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

1006
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,277
Oh.

1007
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,988
I think you got the wrong car, mcfly.

1008
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,328
George, help me! Please!

1009
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,287
Just turn around, mcfly, and walk away.

1010
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,501
- Lorraine: Please, George.
- Are you deaf, mcfly?

1011
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,674
Close the door and beat it.

1012
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:18,848
No, biff. You leave her alone.

1013
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,387
All right, mcfly.

1014
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:28,266
You're asking for it,
and now you're going to get it.

1015
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,151
Biff, stop it!

1016
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,438
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1017
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,191
Biff, no!

1018
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,322
Marvin: Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1019
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,951
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

1020
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,498
- Whose are these?
- Mine.

1021
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,497
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1022
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:50,704
You're going to break his arm!

1023
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,500
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1024
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,052
Let him go! Let him go!

1025
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,795
Are you okay?

1026
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:55,478
- Who is that guy?
- That's George mcfly.

1027
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,739
- That's George mcfly?
- Excuse me.

1028
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,497
The storm.

1029
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:20,176
Hey, guys, you gotta get back in there
and finish the dance.

1030
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,674
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

1031
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,160
He can't play with his hand like that,
and we can't play without him.

1032
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,641
Yeah, well. Look, Marvin, you got to play.

1033
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,957
See, that's where they kiss
for the first time on the dance floor.

1034
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:32,126
And if there's no music, they can't dance.
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

1035
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,516
If they can't kiss,
they can't fall in love and I'm history.

1036
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:35,771
Hey, man, the dance is over

1037
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:38,399
unless you know somebody else
that can play the guitar.

1038
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,201
This is for all you lovers out there.

1039
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:54,833
Marvin: Earth angel, earth angel

1040
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:58,207
will you be mine?

1041
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:01,464
My darling dear

1042
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:05,677
- George, aren't you going to kiss me?
- I don't know.

1043
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:09,593
Scram, mcfly. I'm cutting in.

1044
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:20,571
Earth angel, earth angel

1045
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,072
the one I adore

1046
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,151
hey, boy, you all right?

1047
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,744
I can't play.

1048
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:28,911
George!

1049
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,631
George!

1050
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:50,221
George.

1051
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:54,683
Excuse me.

1052
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:06,733
The vision of your happiness

1053
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,122
earth angel, earth angel

1054
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:16,001
please be mine

1055
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,704
my darling dear

1056
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:22,086
love you for all time

1057
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:26,128
I'm just a fool

1058
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,261
a fool in love

1059
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,933
with you

1060
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,693
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

1061
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:47,695
No. I got to go.

1062
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:51,278
Come on, man.
Let's do something that really cooks.

1063
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:54,160
Something that cooks.

1064
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,664
- All right.
- Marvin: All right!

1065
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,044
All right.

1066
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:11,386
All right, this is an oldie, but...

1067
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:16,762
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

1068
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:24,190
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

1069
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:43,964
Way down in Louisiana
down in New Orleans

1070
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,792
way back up in the woods
among the evergreens

1071
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,715
there stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood

1072
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:52,430
where lived a country boy
name of Johnny b. Goode

1073
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,180
he never ever learned
to read or write so well

1074
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,849
he could play the guitar
just like he's ringing a bell

1075
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:01,940
go, go go, Johnny, go, go

1076
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,518
go, Johnny, go, go, go

1077
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:06,941
go, Johnny, go, go

1078
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,648
hey, George, I heard you laid out biff.
Nice going.

1079
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:12,029
George, you ever think
of running for class president?

1080
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,532
Johnny b. Goode

1081
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,537
go, Johnny, go, go

1082
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,290
go, Johnny, go, go, go

1083
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,122
go, Johnny, go, go

1084
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:27,424
go, Johnny, go, go, go

1085
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,877
Johnny b. Goode

1086
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,974
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

1087
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,643
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1088
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,472
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1089
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:43,431
Well, listen to this.

1090
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:55,971
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.

1091
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,924
But your kids are going to love it.

1092
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,554
Lorraine.

1093
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:08,892
Marty, that was very interesting music.
Yeah.

1094
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:13,030
I hope you don't mind, but George
asked if he could take me home.

1095
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:17,743
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.

1096
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:20,119
I have a feeling, too.

1097
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:21,863
Listen, I got to go,

1098
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:26,668
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been educational.

1099
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:30,171
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1100
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:32,590
I guarantee it.

1101
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:36,090
Well, Marty, I want to thank you
for all your good advice.

1102
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,513
I'll never forget it.

1103
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,806
Right, George.

1104
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:45,679
Well, good luck, you guys.

1105
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,355
Oh!

1106
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,607
One other thing. If you
guys ever have kids,

1107
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,110
and one of them, when he's eight years old,

1108
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,193
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1109
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:02,153
go easy on him.

1110
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,451
Okay.

1111
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:12,172
Marty. Such a nice name.

1112
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,255
Damn! Where is that kid?

1113
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,718
Damn!

1114
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,555
Damn! Damn!

1115
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:39,275
You're late!
Do you have no concept of time?

1116
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:41,735
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1117
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,742
Do you think I'm going back
in that zoot suit?

1118
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:47,495
The old man really came through. It worked.

1119
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:49,667
He laid out biff in one punch.

1120
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:54,123
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to biff in his life.

1121
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,502
- Never?
- No. Why? What's the matter?

1122
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:03,306
All right! Let's set your destination time.

1123
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,396
This is the exact time you left.

1124
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:14,233
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

1125
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:19,322
It'll be like you never left.

1126
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:25,491
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1127
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,447
That's where you'll start from.

1128
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:32,627
I've calculated the precise distance,
taking into account the acceleration speed

1129
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:37,208
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes,

1130
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:41,796
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1131
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,724
- When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.
- Right.

1132
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:55,567
Well, I guess that's everything.

1133
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:02,320
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1134
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,656
See you in about 30 years.

1135
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:12,701
I hope so.

1136
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,920
Don't worry!

1137
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,297
As long as you hit that wire

1138
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:21,467
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour,

1139
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,512
the instant the lightning strikes the tower

1140
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,350
- everything will be fine.
- Right.

1141
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,942
- What's the meaning of this?
- You'll find out in 30 years.

1142
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,115
It's about the future, isn't it?

1143
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,944
It's information about the future.
Wait a minute.

1144
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:51,873
I warned you about this, kid.
The consequences could be disastrous!

1145
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,372
Doc, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

1146
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,295
- Your life depends on it!
- No!

1147
01:33:57,757 --> 01:34:01,090
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1148
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,377
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

1149
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,553
Great Scott!

1150
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,522
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

1151
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:22,399
Right! I got it!

1152
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:57,848
Doc!

1153
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:09,780
- Come on, come on. Let's go!
- All right! Take it up!

1154
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,121
Gol

1155
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,252
Doc! “What?

1156
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,801
I have to tell you about the future.

1157
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:31,424
- What?
- I have to tell you about the future!

1158
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:32,848
What?

1159
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:37,771
On the night I go back in time, you get...

1160
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:42,517
Doc!

1161
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:52,994
Gol

1162
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:56,288
- no, doc!
- Look at the time!

1163
01:35:56,376 --> 01:36:00,335
You've got less than four minutes.
Please, hurry!

1164
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:13,306
Yeah!

1165
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:09,817
Damn it, doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

1166
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:11,863
If I only had more time.

1167
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,237
Wait a minute. I got all the time I want.

1168
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:20,916
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

1169
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:23,539
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1170
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:30,383
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1171
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,961
Engine running. All right.

1172
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:37,758
No. No, no.

1173
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:41,519
Come on. Not this time. Come on. Come on.

1174
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,294
Marty: Come on.

1175
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:58,505
Here we go. Here we go. This time. Come on.

1176
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:02,676
Please. Please. Come on!

1177
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,358
Doc.

1178
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:20,631
Crazy drunk driver.

1179
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,555
Whoo!

1180
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:38,016
All right. Red.

1181
01:42:39,528 --> 01:42:42,315
You look great. Everything looks great.

1182
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:47,567
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, doc!

1183
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:55,992
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

1184
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:11,098
Libyans.

1185
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:34,784
Marty: No!

1186
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:37,617
You bastard!

1187
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,306
Terrorist: Go!

1188
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,793
Doc! Doc!

1189
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,429
No! No!

1190
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:52,858
You're alive.

1191
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:03,702
Bulletproof vest?

1192
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,710
How did you know?

1193
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,922
I never got a chance to tell you.

1194
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:27,523
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events?

1195
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:29,695
The space-time continuum?

1196
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:33,069
Well, I figured, what the hell?

1197
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:48,335
- So, how far ahead are you going?
- About 30 years. It's a nice, round number.

1198
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:52,885
Look me up when you get there, all right?
Guess I'll be about 47.

1199
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:54,212
I will.

1200
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,427
- Take care.
- You, too.

1201
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,434
Right. Bye-bye, einie.

1202
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:03,930
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1203
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:05,935
You bet.

1204
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:12,540
What a nightmare.

1205
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,856
Linda: If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

1206
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:29,085
David: Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

1207
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:32,601
second of all, somebody named Greg or
Craig called you just a little while ago.

1208
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:34,277
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

1209
01:47:34,365 --> 01:47:37,072
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

1210
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:38,274
Hey.

1211
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:42,616
- What the hell is this?
- Breakfast.

1212
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:45,786
David: Did you sleep in your clothes
again last night?

1213
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:47,207
Yeah. I...

1214
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,749
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

1215
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:53,881
Marty, I always wear a suit to the office.

1216
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:57,425
You all right? Yeah.

1217
01:47:58,222 --> 01:47:59,366
Lorraine: I think we need
a rematch, George.

1218
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:00,425
A rematch?

1219
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:02,632
- Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

1220
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,591
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1221
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:08,179
Mom! Dad!

1222
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:10,210
- Did you hit your head?
- Marty, are you all right?

1223
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:14,227
You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

1224
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:17,108
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1225
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:20,657
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1226
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:24,411
- Good morning, Dave. Linda.
- David: Good morning, mom.

1227
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,989
Linda: Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1228
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:30,702
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1229
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:35,294
- Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
- What? What, ma?

1230
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:39,502
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1231
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:42,258
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1232
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:43,464
The car's wrecked.

1233
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:45,140
Wrecked? Wrecked?

1234
01:48:45,227 --> 01:48:47,434
- When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?
- Quiet down.

1235
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,011
I'm sure the car is fine.

1236
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:51,418
David: Why am I always the last one
to know about these things?

1237
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:54,525
See? There's biff out there
waxing it right now.

1238
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:59,279
Now, biff, I want to make sure that we get
two coats of wax this time, not just one.

1239
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:03,609
- I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
- Now, biff, don't con me.

1240
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:07,158
I'm sorry, Mr. mcfly.

1241
01:49:07,249 --> 01:49:10,332
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1242
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:15,254
Biff. What a character.
Always trying to get away with something.

1243
01:49:15,758 --> 01:49:18,716
I've had to stay on top of biff
ever since high school.

1244
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:22,545
Although, if it wasn't for him...
We never would have fallen in love.

1245
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,095
That's right.

1246
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:27,348
Mr. mcfly! Mr. mcfly, this just arrived.

1247
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:30,223
Oh, hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

1248
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:36,650
Honey! Your first novel.

1249
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:37,839
George: Like I've always told you,

1250
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:40,730
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1251
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:45,238
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1252
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:46,989
Keys?

1253
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,884
How about a ride, mister?
Jennifer.

1254
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:11,260
Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes!
Let me look at you.

1255
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:14,889
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1256
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:16,393
I haven't.

1257
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:20,227
You okay? Is everything all right?

1258
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:24,649
Marty: Oh, yeah.

1259
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:28,656
Everything is great.

1260
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:47,129
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

1261
01:50:47,933 --> 01:50:50,390
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1262
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:57,139
Wait a minute. What are you doing, doc?

1263
01:50:58,152 --> 01:50:59,232
I need fuel.

1264
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:05,110
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1265
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,236
No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay?

1266
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,389
Jennifer's here.
We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

1267
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:12,655
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1268
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,394
Wait a minute, doc.
What are you talking about?

1269
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,454
What happens to us in the future?

1270
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:19,503
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, no, no, no, Marty.

1271
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,878
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1272
01:51:22,968 --> 01:51:25,209
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1273
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:34,685
Hey, doc, we better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1274
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:38,935
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
