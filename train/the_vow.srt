Hey, I have this theory.

Mmm-hmm.

20
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:35,190

Mmm-hmm.

23
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:45,407
I have a theory, too. My
theory is about moments.

24
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,946
Moments of impact.

25
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:49,333
My theory is that these
moments of impact,

26
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,538
these flashes of high intensity

27
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:54,773
that completely turn our
lives upside down,

28
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,642
actually end up defining who we are.

00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,955
Thanks.

Oh!

33
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,375
You forgot your permit.

34
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:30,139
Yeah. Well, I just sort of come here
to enjoy the two-hour line.

35
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,706

Well, thank you for this, Leo.

42
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,403
You know what, I noticed, in a
totally non-threatening way,

43
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,341
we have the same RPP zone.

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,274
Is that right?

45
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:03,208
Yup.

46
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:04,778
Hmm.

47
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,519
You have impressive powers
of observation.

48
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:08,952
Yes.

49
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,382
What's an RPP zone?

50
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,055
Residential permit parking zone.

51
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,256

52
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:19,296

Okay.

55
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,471
What I was thinking is that...

56
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,539
I think we owe it to ourselves, really,

57
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,872
to maybe get a drink,

58
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:35,975

compatibility and all.

God, I'm so in love with

92
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,561
As you know, your wife's CTscan

93
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,294
showed intracranial hemorrhaging.

94
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,097
We purposely keep patients with
traumatic brain injuries

95
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,832
in a comatose state in order
to calm their systems

96
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:18,307
and allow the brain time to heal itself
while the swelling subsides.

97
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,205
And then we slowly wean
them off it. Now...

98
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:24,806
The thing is, each one of
us is the sum total of

99
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:27,785
every moment that we've
ever experienced,

100
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,550
with all the people we've ever known.

101
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:46,802
And it's these moments that
become our history.

102
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:51,002
Like our own personal greatest
hits of memories that we play

103
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:54,376
and replay in our minds
over and over again.

104
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,315

Really? No.

108
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:09,652
What's that? Nothing.

109
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,663
Oh, nothing? Food's ready.

110
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,990
Look, if you keep feeding that fleabag,

111
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,662
it's gonna keep coming
back and I'm allergic.

112
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:20,431

to cilantro?

113
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,871
I can't stand cilantro.

114
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,841
Exactly. But you're not allergic.

115
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,276
Does anybody want strawberries I
bought at the farmers' market?

116
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,437
Buying groceries, bad sign.

117
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:28,571
What?

118
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,773
And we all know what that means.

119
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:30,941
I like her.

120
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,219
She's like our mascot.

121
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,850
Thanks, I think.

122
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,583
I would rather have her than that ferret
you tried to make us adopt.

123
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,851
And she makes great coffee.
Let's keep her.

124
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,188
Thank you.

125
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:42,523
- Have some.
- Thank you.

126
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,955
"Movie"? I think you spelled
"movie" wrong.

127
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,225
No.

128
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:57,707
Told you.

I vow to help you love life,

131
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,347
to always hold you with tenderness,

132
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,812
and to have the patience
that love demands.

133
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,589
To speak when words are needed

134
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,862
and to share the silence
when they're not.

135
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:21,055
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.

136
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,030
And to live within the
warmth of your heart

137
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,867
and always call it home.

138
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,566
Wow, you set the bar kind of high.

139
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,573
Did you write your vows on a menu?

140
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,171
Yeah. Why?

141
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,953
I vow to fiercely love you

142
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,893
in all your forms, now and forever.

143
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:58,294
I promise to never forget that this
is a once-in-a-lifetime love.

144
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,273
And to always know in the
deepest part of my soul

145
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:09,575
that no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,

146
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:14,050
that we'll always find the
way back to each other.

147
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:20,492
Do you take each other
as spouses forever?

148
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:21,887
I do.

149
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:25,891
I do.

150
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,566

00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,426
I kind of think it's already powerful.

186
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,629
What?

187
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:47,469
You totally love me.

188
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,204
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

189
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,477
I know because this is my piece,

190
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,114
and that's the scrap pile,

191
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,777
which I'm now saving.

192
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,118
Hmm.

193
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:49,097
A moment of total physical, mental,
and every other kind of love.

194
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,637
Don't crowd her.

195
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,606
She's gonna be a little groggy,

196
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,513
so let's just give her some space.

197
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:05,810
Hey.

198
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,786
It's so good to see you.

199
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,360
Paige?

200
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,526
It's okay. You're in the hospital.

201
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:26,561
You were in a car accident.

202
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,572
You hit your head, but you're okay.

203
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:31,404
We just kept you asleep
for a little while.

204
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,139
How do you feel?

205
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,973
My head hurts.

206
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,849
Yeah, well, that's perfectly normal.

207
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,478
I'll get you something for that.

208
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,853
Was anyone else hurt, Doctor?

209
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,224
Uh...

210
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:56,200
Paige, you know who I am, right?

211
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,737
Yeah. You're my doctor.

212
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,240
Um...

213
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,784
I'm your husband.

214
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:24,253
Paige?

215
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,210
Mr. Collins? You said things
were very good.

216
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:47,946
A brain injury isn't like a broken
bone or a laceration.

217
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:49,419
Brains are much less predictable.

218
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:52,716
Sometimes, due to the way the swelling
tissue presses against the skull,

219
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:53,952
it can cause some impairment.

220
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,550
Some impairment?

221
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:56,754
She doesn't remember me.

222
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,592
Even though she's awake, the swelling

223
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:00,723
can cause confusion or memory loss,

224
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,097
erratic mood swings.

225
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,428
What? But that's normal.

226
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,745
So, that's my theory.

227
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:18,477
That these moments of impact
define who we are.

228
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,852
But what I never considered

229
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,651
was what if, one day, you could
no longer remember any of them?

230
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:44,634
Hi.

231
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,938
What are you up to?

232
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:48,104
Sleeping.

233
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,777
Right.

234
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,549
I brought you some clothes.

235
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,985
Thank you.

236
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,623
I'm kind of hungry.

237
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,055
Okay.

238
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,329
Come on.

239
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,364
So, I just wanted to verify a
few things with you about me,

240
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,006
about us.

241
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,504
Great. So, we're married?

242
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,039
Yes. Yeah.

243
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:23,081
And I have weird hair.

244
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,880
I think that's taking a narrow view.

245
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:28,746
You said it takes too
long to straighten

246
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,845
and you'd rather use that time
to work in your studio.

247
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,687
My studio? Why do I have a studio?

248
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,551
You're an artist.

249
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:40,227
Sculptor. A really good one.

250
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,164
Right now, you're working
on four pieces

251
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:44,827
for the Tribune Tower lobby,

252
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,269
which is huge.

253
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,738
Everyone in town wanted
that commission.

254
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,173
But your show at the MCA's
12 x 12 was amazing,

255
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,733
so you won it.

256
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:54,913
What about my law degree?

257
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,450
I don't have a law degree?

258
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,010
I think you were

259
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:02,610
a few credits shy.

260
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,190
Last time I wanted to be an artist,

261
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:08,556
I was in high school.

262
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,964
I think you need to look
at it like a win.

263
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,193
Traumatic brain injury is
a win? You're an idiot.

264
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,036
If she doesn't remember who you are,

265
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,436
then she doesn't remember all
the stupid shit you ever did.

266
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,030
You can start over, wipe
the slate clean.

267
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,639
I'm just worried if she
doesn't remember you,

268
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,144
how's she going to remember she's
in love with you? What?

269
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,271
I was frankly a little stunned

270
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:30,439
she went for you the first time.

271
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:32,244
If anything, you've become
less attractive.

272
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,449
You guys are a great support system.

273
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,424
Seriously, though.

274
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,891
What if she doesn't remember me?

275
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,786
Then what?

276
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,789
She's gonna remember you.

277
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,459
She's gonna remember all of us.

278
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,831
We're her family.

279
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,238
Yeah, you're right.

280
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,758
Excuse me. I'm looking for
my wife, Paige Collins.

281
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,027
She was right over here yesterday.

282
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,859
Well, it looks like they moved
her up to the VIP floor.

283
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:28,030
That sounds expensive.
It's a donor's wing.

284
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:29,936
Just go down here and take the elevator

285
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,034
to the second floor and make a right.

286
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,668
Okay. Thanks.

287
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,883
Paige, your long-term memory
recall is intact

288
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:45,355
and I'm very optimistic the rest of your
memory is going to improve with time.

289
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:48,486
Mr. Collins, I'm so glad you're here.

290
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,965
This is bizarre. I'm Leo,
Paige's husband.

291
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,569
Do you know how disconcerting
it was to hear second-hand

292
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,367
that my daughter had been
in the ICU for weeks

293
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,474
and we hadn't been told?

294
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,309
You should have called us.

295
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:06,742
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:10,374
You've never met my parents?

297
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,507
I don't understand. Why
haven't you met him?

298
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,576
So, Doctor, now what is the next step?

299
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:17,012
The sooner she settles
back into her life,

300
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:19,681
her normal routine, the better.

301
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,316
Starting in a week or so,
I'm gonna recommend

302
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:23,224
that Paige see a neural psychologist.

303
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,862
Okay.
- Whatever she needs.

304
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,192
Therapy, specialists,

305
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,732
I'll make sure she gets the best.

306
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,595
You'll come home where I
can take care of you.

307
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,426
Mom can make up your old room,

308
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:33,698
and I can take some time off work.

309
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,670
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

310
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,266
'cause we really appreciate that,

311
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,545
but you just heard Paige's doctor say

312
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,173
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine.

313
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:45,341
Her life with me is her normal routine.

314
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,612
Yes, but that's a life
she doesn't remember.

315
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:48,845
She will.

316
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,183
That's what her doctor just
got through saying.

317
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:53,224
No. What she said was that
maybe Paige will remember.

318
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,453
Now, why not let her come home

319
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,529
and recover with people that she knows?

320
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,688
And loves?

321
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:00,527
We're only trying to do
the best for Paige.

322
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,601
That's interesting, 'cause you
haven't even asked her once.

323
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,601
Well, no, but... What I really
need is for everyone

324
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:06,432
to just stop bickering!

325
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,435
Listen, none of this needs
to be decided right now.

326
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:11,600
No. Sorry.

327
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,076
I think you should all head
home, get some rest.

328
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,239
I'm sure everyone could use it.

329
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:17,776
How is it that you're my husband

330
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,248
and you've never met my family?

331
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:23,054
You haven't spoken to them in years.

332
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:27,291
Why would I ever stop speaking
to my family?

333
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,688
It all went down before we met.

334
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,759
And we never talked about it?

335
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:33,058
No, we did.

336
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:36,092
So?

337
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,204
For starters, you wanted
to move into the city

338
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,569
and go to the Art Institute.

339
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:45,634
And your father insisted that
you stay in law school.

340
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:47,206
He had some pretty strict views

341
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,405
on what you ought to be doing.

342
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,707
Things just spiraled from there.

343
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:56,113
Okay. Look, what I remember
is being in law school

344
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,985
and being engaged to Jeremy.

345
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:05,161
I... I don't know.

346
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:13,431
Paige.

347
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:16,434
Okay, babe, babe, just, just...

348
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:20,272
The best thing to do at this point

349
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:23,678
is to go back to your life with me.

350
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,941
You heard what the doctor said.

351
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,315
It's the best thing for your recovery.

352
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,580
Okay, but I don't know you.

353
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,783
And I'm just supposed
to get in your car

354
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:34,018
and go and live at your place?

355
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,317
It's our place.

356
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:37,486
Without any proof of us
even being in love?

357
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:38,654
Other than our marriage?

358
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,698
People get married for all kinds
of different reasons.

359
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,164
Okay. Like?

360
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,598
Like for a green card.

361
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,361
I'm from Cincinnati.

362
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,671
Did I keep a journal?

363
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,007
No, not that I know of.

364
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,385
I guess this is all he could find.

365
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,954
Oh, well. It looks fine, honey.

366
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,863
I mean, we're just going home, so...

367
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,660
It's horrible... Paige?

368
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,495
I understand you're finally leaving us.

369
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,132
Oh, yes, that's what they tell me.

370
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,736
So, no driving until I
give you the say-so.

371
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,649
But other than that, I'm gonna
see you in four to six weeks.

372
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,316
All right? Thank you so much.

373
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:35,410
Thank you, Doctor, for everything.
- Thank you, Doctor.

374
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,216
Okay. You ready? Let's go.

375
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,483
Wait, hold on. I got a voicemail.

376
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,025
It's from before the accident.

377
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:43,823
You said you wanted evidence.

378
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:47,024
Okay, yeah. Well, let's have a listen.

379
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,900
Hey, baby.

380
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,437
Ugh. I'm sorry, I'm still at my studio.

381
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,236
I miss you so bad my sculptures
are starting to look like you.

382
00:24:57,743 --> 00:25:00,041
So, what are you doing later?

383
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:03,773
I kind of need some Leo time,
if you know what I mean.

384
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:08,284
Yeah. Anyway, call me back.

385
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,518
Love you.

386
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:17,760
I don't know, I guess in
listening back to it,

387
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,262
it doesn't exactly prove anything.

388
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,058
No, no, it's...

389
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:25,794
It's cute. I mean, I sound happy.

390
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,368
Okay, look. Think about it.

391
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,637
You quit law school, you broke
off your engagement

392
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,076
and you moved into the city.

393
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:37,308
Those were all choices that you made,

394
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,782
way before you even met me.

395
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,080
I think that you owe it to yourself

396
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:45,819
to honor those decisions,
at least for right now.

397
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:50,456
This is a mistake, Paige.

398
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:53,060
I promise that I will take care of her.

399
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:57,326
Please, come home with
me. Come home with me.

400
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,394
We'll figure this out together.

401
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,679
I guess I could just try it out

402
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:11,978
to see if it would help
my memory and...

403
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,108
Mmm-hmm.

404
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:17,146
I could always come home
if I change my mind.

405
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,754
I married him. It must have
been for some reason.

406
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,250
A guarded endorsement.

407
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,761
But I will take it.

408
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,938
I look like a freak.

409
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:40,468
I think you look great.

410
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,708
Where do we live?

411
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,150
On the north side.

412
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,523
Who's the president?

413
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,628
Of the country? Yeah.

414
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,625
Obama.

415
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,031
The senator?

416
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,661
Yeah. You voted for him.

417
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,166
I did?

418
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,742
Welcome home.

419
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,088
After you.

420
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:33,589
Surprise!

421
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:38,327
Uh...

422
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,203
It's good to see you.

423
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:42,704
We were there every day
at the hospital,

424
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,435
but Leo didn't want us
to overwhelm you.

425
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:46,204
Yeah. They were. Every day.

426
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:47,768
We really missed you.

427
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,848
I gather we're close?

428
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:56,047
I'm Sonia. And this is
my boyfriend Kyle.

429
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,414
Hey, Paige.

430
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:58,546
And this is Jim.

431
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:00,391
You look great, Paige.

432
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,892
And Lily.

433
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,722
Hey. What, were you, like, working
out at the hospital?

434
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:06,855
Hey, Paige.
- And Josh.

435
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:10,429
I... Sorry, I... Excuse me.

436
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,099
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sorry it ended early.

437
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,576
It's all right. Take care, Leo.

438
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,331
Are you okay?

439
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:53,239
What do you think?

440
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:57,078
I know. It's a lot to take in.

441
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:58,941
No.

442
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:03,247
A lot to take in would've
been coming home,

443
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:07,781
to a strange apartment, with
a man I don't know.

444
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,326
That would be a lot to take in.

445
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,157
But coming home to all of that,

446
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,131
plus a house full of people

447
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:20,604
pulling on me, and hugging
me, and crying in my face,

448
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:22,936
and talking about more shit
that I don't remember,

449
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:26,102
that's not a lot to take in,
that's total bullshit.

450
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,635
You're right.

451
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,647
It was only supposed
to be a few people.

452
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:33,046
Will you please just get out?

453
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:40,487
Paige, I'm sorry.

454
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,056
Are you honestly not gonna
leave me alone?

455
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:45,562
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

456
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:47,830
Of course.

457
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm sorry.

458
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:42,183
Oh.

459
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:45,223
Oh, my God. Oh, my mother's
gonna kill me.

460
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:05,939
Good morning. Good morning.

461
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:09,803
What? You didn't knock!

462
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,583
It's habit. I'm sorry.

463
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,276
It's not like you haven't
seen it before. Come on.

464
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:22,092
This is not funny. You should knock.

465
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:23,726
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,436
You look nice.

467
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,739
Really?

468
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:47,808
This is about the only piece of my
clothing I feel comfortable in.

469
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,119
That's mine, actually.

470
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:52,282
Oh.

471
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:53,981
No, it's fine.

472
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,427
What? Huh?

473
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,303
You're looking at me like I'm
some kind of zoo animal.

474
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,637
Sorry, I don't know. I'm just trying

475
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,140
to figure this out, too, I guess.

476
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,680
You normally do all this?

477
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:21,115
This is my apology for last night.

478
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:24,286
That was such a bonehead move.
I just wasn't thinking.

479
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:26,617
No, please. I'm sorry. I...

480
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,324
I don't want you to worry
about me, okay?

481
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:33,295
Just go about your normal
routine and...

482
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:37,201
Do you work? Do you have a job?

483
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,495
Yeah. Well, that's if I'm
still in business.

484
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,468
I own a recording studio.

485
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,775
Hmm. Cool.

486
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:56,113
So, what is my routine?
What do I do all day?

487
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,049
Well...

488
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:02,292
You usually get up and make coffee.

489
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,351
All right. No, no, no. I got
it, I got it, I got it.

490
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,862
I did it this morning, I think.

491
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,067
And then you... Oh, no, don't.
That one's for me.

492
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:13,329
You don't eat meat.

493
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,368
Oh.

494
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:22,410
Then you check e-mails and pay bills.

495
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,407
Okay.

496
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:27,713
Which I'm betting that you don't
remember any of the passwords

497
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,877
or account numbers, huh? Mmm-mmm.

498
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,046
So, I guess I'll do that.

499
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,384
Okay.

500
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:35,886
And then you go down to your studio.

501
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:38,019
I could take you down there, show
you what you're working on.

502
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:41,725
You know what? We don't have to
rehash everything right now.

503
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,198
I mean, just...

504
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:46,499
You go to work, and we can make

505
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:48,436
flashcards later, or something.

506
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:51,434
Are you sure?

507
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:53,010
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

508
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:56,874
Okay. Well, your, look...

509
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,543
You got keys, phone here.

510
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:04,445
If you need me, all my
numbers are on there.

511
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,247
Okay. Okay.

512
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:11,624
All right. Yup.

513
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,559
Have a good day.

514
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:39,056
What's up, Lil? Hey.

515
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,385
Fill me in.

516
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,722
That guy, Pointy Shoes? He's
a really bad kisser.

517
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:44,724
I don't think I'm gonna
keep him in rotation.

518
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:47,128
Okay.

519
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,634
Honestly, though, it's
actually been hell.

520
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,896
Yesterday, we were somehow
double-booked.

521
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,399
Too many clients, that's
a high-class problem.

522
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,097
Yeah, but with only one studio,

523
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,405
it's pretty impossible
to take on both gigs.

524
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,809
Right? So, Dune Advertising
weren't flexible

525
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:02,971
and they rebooked over at Soundspace.

526
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,414
Wait? What? Come on. That's
a big account.

527
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:09,319
They should always be prioritized.

528
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,581
You know that.

529
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:11,747
Yeah. Look...

530
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,927
I can't run the sessions and handle
account services, right?

531
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,622
This isn't a one-woman operation.

532
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,594
It's not like I flaked or something.

533
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,792
I know, I get it. I'm not mad.

534
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,267
I'm just... I'm just saying
shit's slipping.

535
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:27,834
Well, I'm here now.

536
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,341
How's she doing?

537
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:34,707
She's getting there.

538
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:37,710
She's...

539
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,439
Look, thanks.

540
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,649
It'll be fine.

541
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,852
Okay. Good.

542
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,859
So, you'll be at the 3:30 pitch?

543
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,356
Of course.

544
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,897
I'm going to head home, then
change, and check on Paige,

545
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,160
but I'll be there. Okay.

546
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,878
I vow to help you love life,

547
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,314
to always hold you with tenderness,

548
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:20,255
and to have the patience
that love demands.

549
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,553
To speak when words are needed

550
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,493
and to share the silence
when they're not.

551
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:28,828
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.

552
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,369
And to live within the
warmth of your heart

553
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:34,029
and always call it home.

554
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:36,506
Did you write your vows on a menu?

555
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,671
Weird.

556
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:42,770
I vow to fiercely love you

557
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:46,078
in all your forms, now and forever.

558
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:50,786
I promise to never forget that this
is a once-in-a-lifetime love.

559
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:55,390
And to always know in the
deepest part of my soul,

560
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,092
no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,

561
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,896
that we'll always find the
way back to each other.

562
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:17,638
Oh, hi.
- Hi.

563
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:21,875
Could I have a...

564
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,153
One of these?

565
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:25,654
You don't want the usual?

566
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,251
I have a usual?

567
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:31,226
That would be perfect.
I'll have the usual.

568
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,090
All right.

569
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:35,223
Here you go.

570
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,064
Thank you.

571
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:41,972

Where you been? I was starting
to get a little worried.

592
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,720
Thought something might've
happened to you.

593
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,389
Sorry. I was lost, physically.

594
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:17,332
Mentally, I guess, as well.

595
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:19,131
Well, you should've called me.

596
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,068
Yeah, I forgot the phone

597
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:22,867
and I don't know your number by heart,

598
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:24,407
so I called my mom

599
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,171
and we made a day of
it, which was great.

600
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,504
She invited us for dinner tonight.

601
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,746
Dinner? Okay.

602
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:37,918
You don't have to go.

603
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,684
Well, you're not allowed to
drive, so I do have to go.

604
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:42,658
But that's not the point.

605
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:48,764
You know, maybe I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow

606
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,561
and remember everything,

607
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:53,603
but right now they're the only
thing I'm sure about.

608
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,102
Okay.

609
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:01,275
We'll go.

610
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:04,341
Okay.

611
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,076
Okay.

612
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:08,413
Are you gonna change?

613
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,120
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

614
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:13,087
Changing.

615
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,790
It's just a left up here
at the Caldwells',

616
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,226
and then a right at the cul-de-sac,

617
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,265
and we're six houses in on the right.

618
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:24,425
Oh, the Prestleys got a
new mailbox. So cute.

619
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,704
You know, this arrangement
doesn't exactly say,

620
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,400
"I'm sorry that we haven't spoken,

621
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:31,635
"but now that I have a brain injury,

622
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,472
"maybe you can overlook it."

623
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,245
You're right.

624
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:37,975
We should've got them forget-me-nots.

625
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:40,240
That's funny.

626
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:44,111
Actually, that is funny.

627
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,390
So, well, you've already
met my parents,

628
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,258
but my dad will say to call him Bill,
but he prefers Mr. Thornton.

629
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,421
And my sister's name is...

630
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:53,828
Gwen.

631
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:56,994
I know a lot about your family, Paige.

632
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,500
Right. Yeah.

633
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:00,969
We're married. You know?

634
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:06,835
Oh, my God, you're engaged! I know.

635
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,907
Wow.

636
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:12,409
You guys make a really cute
couple. Oh, thanks, Paige.

637
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,448
Wow.

638
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:17,982
It has been forever.

639
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,249
Has it?

640
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:20,381
Yeah.

641
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:23,825
The weird thing is that everyone
looks a little bit older.

642
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:25,919
Really? Yeah. You, especially.

643
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:28,659
Oh, I'm... I'm so happy
to have you back.

644
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,131
Voilà.

645
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:34,135
In honor of Paige being home,
I made your favorite dinner.

646
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:36,164
Filet mignon.

647
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,640
Oh, please. Please. Sit down.

648
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,979
Before we start, I think this
evening deserves a toast.

649
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:48,278
Darling?

650
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:51,287
Well, I... I would like
to drink to my family.

651
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:57,756
I am so fortunate to have these three
beautiful women in my life

652
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:01,822
and, when we're all together,
that fortune just multiplies.

653
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,827
Paige, honey, welcome home.

654
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:06,534
To family.

655
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:08,332
To family.

656
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:13,004
So, Leo, what about your family?

657
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:15,444
Do you see them often?

658
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:16,639
No.

659
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:17,806
Oh, that's a shame.

660
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,311
Both my parents are dead.

661
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,608
It's just Paige.

662
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:25,480
She's my family now.

663
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,986
And what kind of work do you do, Leo?

664
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,123
I just opened up my own recording
studio downtown.

665
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,965
Paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business.

666
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:41,897
I did?

667
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,165
Yeah.

668
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:48,144
Isn't that sort of a dying field?

669
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,845
No, I just mean, can't
people record things

670
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,042
on their computers at home

671
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,209
and they sound just as good? Ryan.

672
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:56,547
What?

673
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,144
Look, the records that I like,

674
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:01,589
they have life and warmth and soul.

675
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,852
Like the slapback on Scotty Moore's
guitar on Mystery Train.

676
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,864
Look, you're not gonna get
that in your computer.

677
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:11,333
You're gonna want a live room, you're
gonna want to bounce to tape.

678
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:15,498
You're gonna want real musicians in
a room, vibing off of each other.

679
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:16,870
You...

680
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:20,104
I guess, to answer your question,
it may be a dying field

681
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:24,580
and you can record high-quality
stuff at home.

682
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,544
But, I mean, come on,

683
00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:30,553
you can't get the Sun Sessions
on your laptop.

684
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,353
Wow.

685
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:38,087
Wow.

686
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:39,961
Wow. Wow.

687
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,801
I heard everyone is gonna
be here tonight.

688
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:49,930
This kind of thing might be a
little too much for Paige.

689
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,407
Oh, no, I'm good here, actually.

690
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,047
Isn't that Diane Chain?

691
00:43:58,482 --> 00:44:01,417
Yeah, we don't really hang out anymore.

692
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:04,249
God, you have been away a long time.

693
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:05,414
Oh, my God!

694
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:09,817
Good luck, man.

695
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:12,157
Hi. Hi!

696
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:16,124
Sorry. Leo, these are my friends
from high school.

697
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,258
This is Shana, Carrie, Lizbet.

698
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:19,564
Hi.

699
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,739
What about me? I don't
get an introduction?

700
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,968
Hi.

701
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,102
Hi.

702
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,180
Sorry, this is...

703
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:35,180
Jeremy.

704
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:36,950
It's been a long time.

705
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,288
Has it?

706
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,593
It doesn't seem like it. You
haven't changed a bit.

707
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:46,255
I'm not sure if she mentioned
it. I'm Leo.

708
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,491
Hi. Paige's husband.

709
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:51,159
Right. I'm gonna grab a drink.

710
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,428
You guys want anything?

711
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:53,629
Disaronno sour?

712
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:55,001
I'll have a blueberry mojito.

713
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:56,266
Really?

714
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,103
Yes, I remember.

715
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:03,507
Oh, my God, Paige.

716
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:04,808
Do you remember when we were
in the ninth grade,

717
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,281
and we were getting ready
for the Christmas dance,

718
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,147
we were curling your hair...

719
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:10,187
We ended up burning off half your hair.

720
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:12,312
I totally remember that!

721
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:15,283
And didn't I wind up having to
wear a beret to the dance?

722
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,758
No, no, no, that was the...

723
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,767
It was like she was some
sweater-set wearing,

724
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:27,167
mojito-drinking sorority girl.

725
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,296
Like a Stepford wife?

726
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,834
Yeah, basically.

727
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:33,136
She was even flirting with Jeremy
right in front of me.

728
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,541
Ex-fiancé Jeremy?

729
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:35,873
No, no. No.

730
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,847
In her mind, it's current
fiancé Jeremy.

731
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,880
Which is why it was probably
pretty annoying

732
00:45:41,986 --> 00:45:45,547
to have her stranger husband
cock-block her all night.

733
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:49,218
That is a lot to get my mind around.

734
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:51,821
So, what turns her on?

735
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,324
Paige?

736
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:55,558
No, her mother.

737
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:57,156
Yes, Paige.

738
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,392
Like, in bed?

739
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:00,902
Oh, my God, Leo.

740
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,528
What? It's private. It's...

741
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,198
I don't know.

742
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:06,037
It's... It's kind of a between-me-and-her
kind of thing.

743
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:08,236
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

744
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:11,842
She likes being tickled.

745
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:14,216
Seriously?

746
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,479
Wow. Thought you weren't gonna judge.

747
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,249
I'm not. I'm just... I...

748
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:19,549
I don't care if you're into kink.

749
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:21,488
It's not like that.

750
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:23,993
It just breaks her down when
she's stuck in her head.

751
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:26,529
Okay. You should give that a shot.

752
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:28,423
Seriously?

753
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:29,726
Yeah. What do you have to lose?

754
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,612
Hey, Lisa. Hey.

755
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:50,012
Paige?

756
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:53,750
Because I've been dealing with these people
forever and I know they have...

757
00:46:56,794 --> 00:46:59,729
Something important just popped up.

758
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:01,890
I'm gonna call you right back. Okay.

759
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:06,866
Hi. Hi.

760
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:09,035
Please.

761
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:20,378
So, you remember that time at the lake,

762
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:24,415
when you told me you'd always
have my back, no matter what?

763
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:25,580
The night in the boathouse.

764
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:27,089
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

765
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,553
Yeah.

766
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,426
So, can you please tell me
what went down with us?

767
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,228
Only you, Paige, can dump a guy,

768
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,324
then come back and demand answers.

769
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:41,427
So I dumped you?

770
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:45,407
A cruel, hard, pre-wedding dumping.

771
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:48,506
Why?

772
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:52,107
Well, that's a question that
I and all of my friends

773
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:54,151
and the two rebound girls,

774
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,116
yeah, we'd all love an answer to.

775
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:57,584
Come on, seriously.

776
00:47:57,655 --> 00:47:59,452
I must have had some kind of reason.

777
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:00,854
You...

778
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:03,349
You... You changed.

779
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:08,330
You talked differently, you
dressed differently.

780
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:11,001
You weren't sure about
law school anymore.

781
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:15,636
And you definitely weren't
sure about me anymore.

782
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:18,870
Did I give you your ring back?

783
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:20,466
Yeah, you did.

784
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,042
Who has that now?

785
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:25,672
No one yet.

786
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:28,778
But I've been with Rose.

787
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,547
You remember? From Gwen's class.

788
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:33,555
I've been with Rose for
about a year now.

789
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,458
I couldn't wait forever, Paige.

790
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,997
You couldn't have anticipated

791
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:45,365
that I'd have a brain trauma
and forget our break-up

792
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,130
and come waltzing into your office

793
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,831
demanding answers?

794
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:50,066
What's wrong with you?

795
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:55,403
I'm sorry. I'm gonna let
you go back to work.

796
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:56,911
Sure.

797
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:13,196
Sorry. I'm sorry.

798
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,059
I was not expecting that.

799
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:17,030
Habit, I guess.

800
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:24,831
I honestly didn't even know where I was
headed until I found myself here.

801
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,608
It just seems so ridiculous to me

802
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:31,272
that I shut everyone
out for five years.

803
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,516
It just doesn't feel right.

804
00:49:51,902 --> 00:49:52,960
Hey.

805
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:56,096
Hey. How was your day?

806
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,401
Uh...

807
00:49:58,475 --> 00:49:59,942
It was fine.

808
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,772
I'm just happy to be home with you.

809
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:09,242
Sorry about the mess here.

810
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,787
No problem.

811
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:12,882
What, are you collaging?

812
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:14,218
Do I collage?

813
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,618
No, not that I remember.

814
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,891
No, you know, I was just so inspired

815
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:24,092
just seeing everybody last night.

816
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:25,633
To collage?

817
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:27,829
All those memories just came
flooding back to me,

818
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:31,635
so I thought I'd make a timeline,
you know, of my life.

819
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:35,307
That's... That's great.
That's a great idea.

820
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,442
Yeah.

821
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:40,813
I kind of rummaged through some of
your stuff. I hope you don't mind.

822
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:44,914
It's fine. It's fine.
What's mine is yours.

823
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:47,479
I even have a certificate from the
State of Illinois to prove it.

824
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,957
Yes, I found that. It's
in the lost years.

825
00:50:51,195 --> 00:50:52,856
See, I started over here.

826
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:56,330
I found some family photos, me when
I was little, stuff like that.

827
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,195
That was easy to put into
chronological order

828
00:50:58,302 --> 00:50:59,530
because I remember that stuff.

829
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:00,830
That's good, right?

830
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:02,667
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

831
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,536
But what I've been trying to do

832
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,768
is pinpoint the last memory I had

833
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:09,312
before everything just went blank.

834
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:11,842
How's that going?

835
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:14,481
I think I was at the Macaroni Grill,

836
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:18,112
and I was asking them if they had
those special toasted ravioli.

837
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:20,554
And I don't remember the answer.

838
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:23,023
That's it, that's all,
that's my last memory

839
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:25,459
before I woke up in a hospital.

840
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:29,999
Oh, no. How are we ever gonna know
if they had toasted ravioli?

841
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,966
God, this is not happening.

842
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,338
It's okay.

843
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,638
This is not happening.

844
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:43,703
Okay? No, no, no, no,
please don't do that.

845
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,242
Come on. What...

846
00:51:49,653 --> 00:51:51,553
What are you doing?

847
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:53,849
I'm sorry.

848
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:58,556
I'm sorry. Was that... That
was one of our things?

849
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:00,887
Yeah, kind of. It... I'm sorry...

850
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:02,055
No. You don't have to say it.

851
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:04,361
You don't. I get it.
It'll all come back.

852
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:06,699
We just have to keep doing
what we're doing,

853
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,431
let you fall back into your life.

854
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:10,530
It'll all sort itself out.

855
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,899
Yeah.

856
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:20,083
About a dozen downtown businesses
were boarded up...

857
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:23,484
About a dozen downtown businesses
were boarded up...

858
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:26,579
Glass littered sidewalks, following
two nights of protests

859
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:27,783
over the police shooting of an...

860
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:28,949
Hey.

861
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:30,720
There were few people on the street.

862
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,796
I think I'm ready to see my studio now.

863
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,227
Will you show it to me?

864
00:52:34,298 --> 00:52:35,595
Yeah.

865
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,065
Come on.

866
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:59,745
This is the first studio you've
ever had to yourself.

867
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:03,519
It's a cool space, huh? Wow.

868
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:11,968
You weren't sure you liked
it at first, though.

869
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:15,163
Until you had this idea to
burn some smudge stick

870
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:18,673
that you bought from some guy
on the corner of Diversey.

871
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:20,968
We lit this thing

872
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:22,136
and we started waving it around

873
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:26,148
until we realized that it was just
some old pieces of lettuce.

874
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,645
So, we're waving around burning
lettuce. I don't know.

875
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:33,952
But it must've done the trick, though,

876
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:37,357
'cause after that, I couldn't
get you out of here.

877
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:41,995
You would come in and crank your music,

878
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:43,862
and you'd get lost in a project,

879
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:47,061
and I'd have to come and remind
you that it was night-time.

880
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:53,807
This is one of your pieces for
the Tribune Tower series.

881
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:56,004
What is it supposed to be?

882
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:59,372
I'm not sure if you even knew yet.

883
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:03,677
But come here.

884
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:05,586
I...

885
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:11,024
Here, just help it figure
out what it wants to be.

886
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,531
Okay.

887
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:19,160
I don't... I don't really know

888
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:20,669
how to use this thing.

889
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:23,570
Sure you do. Wait, hold on.

890
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,874
That's better. Come on.

891
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,713
Just try it. It might be fun.

892
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:37,219
Can you just turn down
the music, please?

893
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,948
I swear you used to listen to it

894
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,284
so much louder than this.

895
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,516
I never could understand
how you would just

896
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:42,684
be able to focus...

897
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,852
I have a clinically bad,
goddamn headache!

898
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,362
Please turn down the music!

899
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:57,264
I'm trying to help you!

900
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:03,135
But I am not your punching bag.

901
00:55:05,716 --> 00:55:07,911
We don't speak to each other like this.

902
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:14,655
This is hard for me, too, Paige.

903
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:00,602
Paige?

904
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,138
Yeah?

905
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:05,167
Hey. Hey.

906
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,140
I passed by that little
Portuguese bakery

907
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,837
that you love on the way home,

908
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:10,776
and I got us some...

909
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:16,644
Is somebody here? Yeah.

910
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:23,025
Leo. Hey.

911
00:56:24,227 --> 00:56:27,390
My sister's just up to her eyeballs
with this wedding stuff,

912
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:29,328
and we've got the engagement
party coming up.

913
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:32,835
And we all thought Paige could
come home and help her out.

914
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:35,371
It just seems like the
right thing to do,

915
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:36,997
to be there for Gwen.

916
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:42,512
Okay. But what about your life here?

917
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:47,342
What about all the work that
you haven't finished?

918
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,442
I talked to the people at the Tribune.

919
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:51,783
And they were really understanding
about the accident,

920
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:53,617
and Dad's gonna loan me the money

921
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,885
to pay back their advance, so...

922
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:58,427
I don't know. I just... I can't do it.

923
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:01,019
You just come out when
you're ready, honey.

924
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:02,861
Okay, thanks, Dad.

925
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:10,733
I'm sorry. It's just until
after the wedding.

926
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:13,535
I just want you to be careful, okay?

927
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:15,875
Well, I'm not joining a cult.

928
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:17,777
I'm just going to stay with my family.

929
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:19,815
I know, but... But what?

930
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:28,391
Can I at least give you an awkward hug?

931
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,475
So, how are you feeling?

932
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:49,909
Mmm. I feel fine.

933
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,143
Yeah? No dizziness, disorientation,
sleepiness?

934
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,081
Nope. Great.

935
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:57,848
Well, I'm very happy, and your
CT scan looks excellent.

936
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,012
Oh.

937
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:00,851
What a relief. Well...

938
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:03,824
So, your memory recall, anything?

939
00:58:03,927 --> 00:58:05,189
Not really.

940
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:06,523
No, huh?

941
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,495
That's not normal, is it?

942
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:10,691
Listen, when it comes to the
brain, nothing is normal,

943
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:12,928
because no two brain injuries
are the same.

944
00:58:13,003 --> 00:58:15,870
Paige seems perfectly herself again.

945
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:17,530
It's wonderful.

946
00:58:17,974 --> 00:58:20,374
Mrs. Thornton, could I just talk to
Paige alone for a moment, please?

947
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:25,043
It's okay, Mom. I'm... I'm good.

948
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:29,316
All right.

949
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,215
Thanks.

950
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:42,498
Paige, do you want to
regain your memory?

951
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:43,692
Yes.

952
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,994
Because some patients fear

953
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:46,330
that when their memory comes back,

954
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:47,802
so will the memory of the trauma,

955
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:49,202
but mercifully that's rarely the case.

956
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:51,467
Oh, no, that's not it. I'm... I'm...

957
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:53,509
I'm not afraid of the accident.

958
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:55,801
So, what are you afraid of?

959
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:02,982
I guess I just... I don't know. It's...

960
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:07,151
I mean, what if I don't like
the life that I had?

961
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:08,816
Or what if I like it too much?

962
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:10,189
I...

963
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,160
I just don't know.

964
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:14,393
I only did one psych rotation,

965
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:16,590
so this may be terrible advice.

966
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,663
But I think you have to
try and fill the holes.

967
00:59:21,538 --> 00:59:23,904
You can still decide you
want a different life,

968
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:25,998
but if you don't at least

969
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:27,509
open yourself up to remembering,

970
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:31,172
I'm afraid you're gonna live
in fear of your own past.

971
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,713
Hey. I'm here.

972
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:39,555
These guys are?

973
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:42,387
Knife Skillz, with a Z.

974
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:43,721
Right.

975
00:59:44,628 --> 00:59:47,961
Okay, Mikey, sounds amazing.
Let's just go for it.

976
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:50,599
I am going for it.

977
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,133
The bass line is one note.

978
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:53,395
Just one note.

979
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,562
Okay, cool.

980
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:56,436
Take two.

981
00:59:59,943 --> 01:00:01,205
Wow.

982
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,041
You look different.

983
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:06,139
Yeah. Going for a Kanye kind of thing.

984
01:00:06,249 --> 01:00:07,876
I'm gonna say more Michael Bublé,

985
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:09,475
but, whatever, it's still good.

986
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:10,711
Hmm.

987
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,953
So... I'm gonna be in
and out for a while.

988
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:21,128
Sounds really good, Mikey.

989
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:24,997
Let's just take it from the top
or the middle or wherever.

990
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:30,005
You know what? People come here
to work with you, okay?

991
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:33,007
I mean, I'm doing my best,
but you gotta be here.

992
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:34,440
I know.

993
01:00:34,844 --> 01:00:37,904
But if Paige is in Lake
Forest with her family,

994
01:00:38,114 --> 01:00:39,638
that's where I gotta be.

995
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:42,479
I gotta make my wife fall
in love with me again.

996
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,922
Oh, you found each other.
- Hi!

997
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,830
Hi. Let's see it.

998
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:00,698
It's good to see you. All
right, take it easy.

999
01:01:00,804 --> 01:01:02,669
The countdown's on, man. Hey, man.

1000
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:04,467
One week left of your former life.

1001
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:05,701
How you feeling?

1002
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,640
I feel pretty good, actually.

1003
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,474
I mean, I do get a little dizzy

1004
01:01:09,546 --> 01:01:10,877
if I think about it for
too long, but...

1005
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:12,039
What?

1006
01:01:13,817 --> 01:01:16,308
No, honey, it's like a good
dizzy. It's like...

1007
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:19,514
It's like panic or excitement.

1008
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:24,493
Well, panic and excitement
are different.

1009
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:26,119
Honey, there's gonna
be 400 people there.

1010
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:27,390
Right.

1011
01:01:27,964 --> 01:01:30,956
Hey, do you also have a little
tingling in your fingers?

1012
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,662
Yeah. Is that bad?

1013
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:34,995
Do you listen to Radiohead?

1014
01:01:35,071 --> 01:01:36,163
Uh-huh.

1015
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,834
Thom Yorke, he talks about
dizzy spells all the time.

1016
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,373
He says when his fingers tingle,

1017
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,937
that's how he knows that he's
creating something genius.

1018
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:47,573
And then he gets so amped up playing

1019
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:49,618
that he almost passes out.

1020
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:53,280
Ryan, it sounds to me like you're
on the verge of genius.

1021
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,517
That's cool, man. Cheers.

1022
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:57,958
Ooh, Ryan, I have someone
I want you to meet.

1023
01:01:58,061 --> 01:01:59,358
Mom, you listen to Radiohead?

1024
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:00,953
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

1025
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:03,089
So, is that true?

1026
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:04,859
Mmm-hmm.

1027
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:12,766
Paige?

1028
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:15,443
Hey, Leo.

1029
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:21,049
What? Your hair.

1030
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:22,584
It looks so different.

1031
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:24,747
You look beautiful.

1032
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:25,947
Thank you.

1033
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:28,921
Okay, look, so I've been thinking
about something.

1034
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:30,390
Okay.

1035
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,722
What's your favorite book?

1036
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:34,894
It's probably not what you remember.

1037
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:36,898
That's fine. That's not the point.

1038
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:39,434
Okay. The Beach House
by James Patterson.

1039
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:41,595
No, really? Yeah.

1040
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:44,298
Okay. The Beach House.

1041
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:48,233
Okay, if it was great, you probably
loaned it to somebody, right?

1042
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:50,336
Yeah. Gwen, I think.

1043
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,108
Okay, and you probably
said to yourself,

1044
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,617
"God, I wish I was the person
that hadn't read it,

1045
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,119
"so that I could experience
it all over again."

1046
01:02:58,188 --> 01:03:00,122
Yeah, I guess so.

1047
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,124
That's how I think we
should look at this.

1048
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:05,522
What?

1049
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,627
You can't remember how we met.

1050
01:03:08,698 --> 01:03:09,790
Mmm-hmm.

1051
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:12,164
And you can't remember
how we fell in love.

1052
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:14,930
And in a way, yeah, that sucks.

1053
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:19,168
But it was the greatest
time of my life.

1054
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:21,771
I just thought how cool it would be

1055
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:23,710
to get to experience it all over again.

1056
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:27,313
Like reading your favorite
book for the first time.

1057
01:03:27,383 --> 01:03:29,180
Exactly. Got you.

1058
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:31,849
Which is why I want to
ask you out on a date.

1059
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,722
A date?

1060
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:38,055
Like two people that are just
meeting for the first time.

1061
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:40,294
Jeremy...

1062
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:43,123
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1063
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,134
Well, I don't know. I mean, you know,

1064
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:47,897
we've got the wedding coming up.

1065
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:49,665
But if we go out before then,

1066
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:52,071
you might still be able to
take me as your date.

1067
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,665
I can't promise anything,

1068
01:03:53,743 --> 01:03:56,075
but I'll put in a good word for you.

1069
01:03:57,914 --> 01:03:59,381
All right.

1070
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:00,915
Yeah? A date.

1071
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:14,153
So, I have an idea, but it involves
going into the city.

1072
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,822
You okay with that?

1073
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:16,991
Yeah, that's fine.

1074
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,557
I just have to be back by
10:00 in the morning.

1075
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:20,761
Oh, my God.

1076
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,894
What?

1077
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:23,198
First date and you're already

1078
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:24,865
inviting yourself to stay the night?

1079
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:27,068
I'm just a little scandalized is all.

1080
01:04:27,177 --> 01:04:28,269
No, I just meant...

1081
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:30,676
Don't worry. I'll have
you back tonight.

1082
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,681
If you wanna stay the night, that's...

1083
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:35,183
I mean, it's... If you want...

1084
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:38,387
You wanna just see how
it goes? All right.

1085
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:41,184
♪ You can love me foolishly

1086
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:45,250
♪ Love me foolish-like

1087
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,296
♪ Well, I wake

1088
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:56,531
♪ In the morning and dress ♪

1089
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,437
Should we get out?

1090
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,406
We don't have to.

1091
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,371
Is this the part of the
date where I find out

1092
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:03,912
you're not actually my husband

1093
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,470
but some crazy stalker,

1094
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:07,641
and you're gonna strangle
me with my purse?

1095
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,776
No. This is the exact parking spot

1096
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:12,377
where we first met.

1097
01:05:13,323 --> 01:05:14,654
Oh.

1098
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,224
I'm gonna take you on a little
retrospective of us.

1099
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:26,932
Mmm.

1100
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,600
That is so good.

1101
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,064
You ready for dessert?

1102
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:33,733
Dessert? Hmm.

1103
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:35,609
We just had waffles.

1104
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:37,339
Mmm-mmm. This is dinner.

1105
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:41,072
These are dessert.

1106
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:46,117
Well, how do you know what
flavors they all are?

1107
01:05:46,189 --> 01:05:49,920
It's like a chocolate Russian roulette.
It's part of the fun.

1108
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:51,517
We'd be surprised by the ones we liked

1109
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:52,993
and the ones we didn't.

1110
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:54,256
Okay.

1111
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:57,492
And...

1112
01:05:58,835 --> 01:05:59,961
You don't like it?

1113
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:01,503
I do not like that one.

1114
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:04,437
Here. Try this one. I think
you'd like this one.

1115
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:11,375
Oh? Mmm.

1116
01:06:11,481 --> 01:06:13,540
Told you. Okay.

1117
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:16,850
Your turn.

1118
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:21,983
Are we going shot for shot?

1119
01:06:27,964 --> 01:06:30,159
Wait till you try their hot chocolate.

1120
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:32,292
We would come here whenever it snowed.

1121
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:34,359
Are you trying to make me
diabetic or just fat?

1122
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,801
No, I...

1123
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:42,567
You got a... It's still in your hair.

1124
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:59,357
So, we come down here at night
and look at the lake?

1125
01:07:00,163 --> 01:07:02,427
That's not exactly what we do.

1126
01:07:07,003 --> 01:07:08,937
I... I'm not...

1127
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:10,864
I don't...

1128
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,237
No, no, it's not that.

1129
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:14,572
We said we'd go in once
a month every month,

1130
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:16,008
and we haven't done April yet.

1131
01:07:17,113 --> 01:07:18,910
We started in July.

1132
01:07:22,185 --> 01:07:24,517
Why? Why would we do that?

1133
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:26,384
We were at this spaghetti place,

1134
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:28,447
and we had this waiter
and he said he did it.

1135
01:07:28,558 --> 01:07:30,924
And he was, like, 80. So
we thought we could.

1136
01:07:31,027 --> 01:07:32,460
Yeah.

1137
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,187
Now, we said no wetsuits, but...

1138
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:35,389
You're serious.

1139
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:37,956
...for you, I guess I'll
make an exception.

1140
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:47,705
All right. Turn around.

1141
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:50,768
Turn around.

1142
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:02,549
Okay.

1143
01:08:03,993 --> 01:08:05,255
Wait. No wetsuit?

1144
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:06,556
We said no wetsuits, right?

1145
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:12,258
Yeah.

1146
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,906
Oh, no.

1147
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:19,566
No, no. No, no!

1148
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:34,685
Come on.

1149
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:46,960
Thank you.

1150
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:51,833
Heat, heat.

1151
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:53,772
My left eyelid's frozen shut.

1152
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:01,640
I can't feel my fingers.

1153
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,280
I can't feel them.

1154
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:20,297
I don't know what your Paige
did on a first date,

1155
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:24,635
but with me, you're only
getting to first base.

1156
01:09:26,509 --> 01:09:27,737
Okay.

1157
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:34,676
I'm sorry. I can do better.

1158
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,684
My... My lips are still numb.

1159
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:41,512
It's nice.

1160
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,196
Second base, tops.

1161
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:55,364
This is perfect.

1162
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:19,254
Thank you for coming
out with me tonight.

1163
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:21,557
I had a really nice time.

1164
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:26,963
I've missed you.

1165
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:30,705
I miss our life together.
I miss being with you.

1166
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:36,644
I love you.

1167
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:47,380
I should probably get inside.

1168
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,958
Good night.

1169
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:53,460
Good night.

1170
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:14,013
Hey.

1171
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:17,949
Hey. I didn't know you
were gonna be here.

1172
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:20,213
Were you out with Jeremy?

1173
01:11:20,323 --> 01:11:21,551
No.

1174
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:23,720
I was with Leo.

1175
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:26,821
I like him.

1176
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:30,693
Yeah.

1177
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:33,558
Me, too.

1178
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:36,861
Are you okay?

1179
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:45,343
Paige, I've never seen
you like this before.

1180
01:11:45,414 --> 01:11:47,848
I mean, is this crying
thing the new you?

1181
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:49,817
Because it's bizarre.

1182
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:51,819
I don't know. I don't know what's me.

1183
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,479
I have a tattoo.

1184
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,921
And I'm a vegetarian, too.

1185
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:04,029
Look, it was just like it used to
be. It was better, actually.

1186
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:06,596
Everything that I fell in love with

1187
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:08,932
about Paige is still there.

1188
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:12,434
You know, to you, I'm sure it seemed

1189
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,872
like a confirmation of your love

1190
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:15,706
or your marriage, right?

1191
01:12:15,778 --> 01:12:17,075
But to her, it probably seemed more

1192
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:18,578
like a really good first date.

1193
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:20,615
Exactly. Which is why I
think you've gotta wait

1194
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,240
the requisite three days
before you call.

1195
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,512
I gotta wait three days

1196
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,053
to call after a date with my own wife?

1197
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:28,682
At least. This is a unique
case. Maybe longer.

1198
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:29,782
It can't be longer.

1199
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:31,086
I'm gonna see her on Saturday
at the wedding.

1200
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:33,024
I'm telling you, it was so obvious.

1201
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:36,064
Even with all this crazy shit going on
around us, we still belong together.

1202
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:37,463
Obvious to her or to you?

1203
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:39,090
To both of us.

1204
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:42,126
- Oh. Oh, Paige?
- Yeah?

1205
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,207
We have to start writing out those
place cards after we eat.

1206
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:46,605
Yes.

1207
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,244
Before you start on that,

1208
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:53,913
I have a little surprise
for you, Paige.

1209
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:55,709
Oh?

1210
01:12:55,785 --> 01:12:57,548
You know Ray Porter, right?

1211
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,282
He taught constitutional
law at Northwestern.

1212
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:01,913
He and I were on law review together.

1213
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:04,391
We've known each other 1,000 years.

1214
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:07,385
He is the dean of the law school now.

1215
01:13:07,463 --> 01:13:08,555
Okay.

1216
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,326
And they're gonna let you back in.

1217
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:11,991
What?

1218
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:13,568
Well...

1219
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,329
I didn't even apply.

1220
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:18,100
I took care of it.

1221
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:23,305
This is crazy.

1222
01:13:25,347 --> 01:13:28,612
I feel like I'm getting
a free do-over in life.

1223
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:02,073
You look like you could use a drink.

1224
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,006
I've already had several.

1225
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,207
But you haven't had this.

1226
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:10,850
All right.

1227
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:14,882
I'm glad we're having a moment alone.

1228
01:15:14,957 --> 01:15:18,449
I haven't gotten a chance to
really talk to you, Leo.

1229
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:19,924
Yeah.

1230
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:21,690
Yeah, cool.

1231
01:15:22,698 --> 01:15:24,359
Congratulations.

1232
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:30,064
That's nice.

1233
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:31,231
Yes, it is.

1234
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:35,867
I've been thinking.

1235
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:41,110
And I think that it's probably time
to let us take it from here.

1236
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:42,479
Take what?

1237
01:15:43,152 --> 01:15:44,915
Things with Paige.

1238
01:15:46,055 --> 01:15:48,285
Look, I know she didn't have
health insurance because

1239
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:51,382
you chose to live in a certain way,

1240
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:54,392
and I know you must be
drowning in debt.

1241
01:15:55,497 --> 01:15:58,057
But I also know a way out of this.

1242
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:00,291
What's that?

1243
01:16:01,437 --> 01:16:02,927
Divorce her.

1244
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:06,437
The bills have only just begun, Leo.

1245
01:16:08,744 --> 01:16:10,803
Mr. Thornton, I don't think
this is the time

1246
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:12,574
or the place to discuss this.

1247
01:16:12,648 --> 01:16:15,640
Fine. If you don't care about
losing your business,

1248
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:18,447
which, clearly, you don't,

1249
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,680
what about Paige?

1250
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:21,415
What about doing what is obviously

1251
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:22,752
the right thing for her?

1252
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:23,951
And you know what's right for her?

1253
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,084
As a matter of fact, I do.

1254
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:27,353
You're such a hypocrite.

1255
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:28,589
What did you say?

1256
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:31,633
If you're such a family
man, how come I...

1257
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,031
I never once saw you come and try

1258
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,126
to put things back together with Paige?

1259
01:16:39,942 --> 01:16:41,807
You're such a coward.

1260
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,155
Hey, can I introduce you
around a little bit?

1261
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:02,558
Can't feel good to be the odd man out.

1262
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:04,326
I'm not the odd man out.

1263
01:17:04,566 --> 01:17:05,897
All right. If you say so.

1264
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,060
You just seem a little creepy
over here all by yourself.

1265
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,161
I'm just waiting for Paige, man.

1266
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,400
All right, well, best
of luck with that.

1267
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:13,975
You like this, right?

1268
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:16,569
I'm sorry, like what?

1269
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:18,203
Paige leaves you behind.

1270
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:20,145
She goes and has this life without you,

1271
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:22,012
with some guy that no one gets.

1272
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:23,642
And now you get to see
her reject all that.

1273
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:26,886
I mean, I like it a little bit.

1274
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:28,387
Yeah?

1275
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,481
Well, let me tell you what I like.

1276
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:32,083
I like the fact that Paige told me

1277
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:33,252
everything about you, Jeremy.

1278
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:35,355
Okay.

1279
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:38,559
She told me that when she was with you,

1280
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:41,895
she would wake up at night in a panic,

1281
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,437
thinking, "Is this all there is?"

1282
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,230
Wow.

1283
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:46,601
She told you everything, huh?

1284
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:47,767
Mmm-hmm.

1285
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:49,274
Did she tell you that she threw herself

1286
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:50,436
at me the other day?

1287
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:52,411
Did she tell you that?

1288
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:54,539
Or did she stop telling you everything

1289
01:17:54,616 --> 01:17:56,208
when she forgot who the hell you were?

1290
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:00,555
Look, I get why you're
being such a dick.

1291
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,521
You obviously love her,

1292
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:04,058
and you think you're
gonna get her back.

1293
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,385
But the thing is, she outgrew you.

1294
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,228
What makes you think that
won't happen again?

1295
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:12,734
Thank you for that advice.

1296
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,361
I will mull it over while I'm
in bed with your wife.

1297
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:18,300
Leo!

1298
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:31,476
Paige, wait!

1299
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:32,713
What the hell were you thinking?

1300
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:34,119
I don't know. That's a
really good question,

1301
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:36,953
because I have been driving
myself insane,

1302
01:18:37,059 --> 01:18:39,323
making a complete ass of myself!

1303
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:40,952
Literally trying everything possible

1304
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:42,291
to try to save what we have.

1305
01:18:42,398 --> 01:18:44,423
And you've been throwing
yourself at Jeremy.

1306
01:18:45,234 --> 01:18:46,428
That's not fair.

1307
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:47,628
It's not fair?

1308
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:52,070
I see the way you look at him.

1309
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:55,171
I know,

1310
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:59,279
because you used to look
at me that way.

1311
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:03,243
Leo, I...

1312
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:05,081
No, I think we need to
start being realistic.

1313
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:06,917
Your memory's not coming back.

1314
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:10,685
The fact is that I'm still
just a stranger.

1315
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,789
I'm not trying to hurt you.

1316
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:18,624
But I'm just...

1317
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:24,938
I'm so tired of disappointing you.

1318
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:28,271
I know.

1319
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:31,639
I'm so sorry.

1320
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:37,550
I'll apologize to Gwen and Ryan.

1321
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:40,383
Oh, God, no, it's fine.

1322
01:19:41,857 --> 01:19:45,691
Wedding disasters have a way of
turning into great stories.

1323
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:48,963
Eventually.

1324
01:19:56,205 --> 01:19:57,536
How do you look at the girl you love

1325
01:19:57,639 --> 01:20:00,631
and tell yourself it's
time to walk away?

1326
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:11,576
Leo?

1327
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:19,820
I hope one day I can love
the way that you love me.

1328
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:25,223
You figured it out once.

1329
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:28,670
You'll do it again.

1330
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:45,644
Shit.

1331
01:21:45,981 --> 01:21:48,074
You're here, not there.

1332
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:50,445
Are you okay?

1333
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:51,816
I'm done.

1334
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,620
It's over. I give up.

1335
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,951
No, you never give up, Leo.

1336
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:59,459
No, if we were meant to be together,

1337
01:21:59,528 --> 01:22:00,893
we would be together.

1338
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:05,124
I was just thinking about
the first time

1339
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,963
that we went to that Greek restaurant

1340
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:08,525
on the corner.

1341
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,571
There was this big banner saying

1342
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:12,071
"Now Serving Soup,"

1343
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:15,238
and I just started to go on and on

1344
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:18,575
about all the obstacles

1345
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,307
that the owner must have overcome

1346
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:22,850
to achieve his lifelong
dream of serving soup.

1347
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,154
And then... And when I was finished...

1348
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:30,883
She didn't say anything
for a few seconds

1349
01:22:30,993 --> 01:22:32,221
and she just...

1350
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:36,591
She just sort of exhaled it.

1351
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,493
It was almost to herself.

1352
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,594
"I love you."

1353
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:47,367
And it just hung there.

1354
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:50,170
It was the first time she had said it,

1355
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:52,406
and I didn't even wanna respond.

1356
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:55,005
I just wanted to keep hearing it.

1357
01:22:57,552 --> 01:23:00,077
That was two weeks after we met.

1358
01:23:02,257 --> 01:23:03,747
It only took her two weeks

1359
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,054
to fall in love with me before.

1360
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:18,868
She doesn't love me.

1361
01:24:11,026 --> 01:24:12,789
Sign here, please.

1362
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,322
Come here, little buddy.

1363
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:01,301
Diane?

1364
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:03,469
Hey.

1365
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:06,373
How are you? Listen...

1366
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:11,247
I know it's been years.

1367
01:25:11,353 --> 01:25:13,821
I was away for a while.

1368
01:25:14,523 --> 01:25:17,253
I never had a chance to apologize.

1369
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,027
I was just going through
a really weird time,

1370
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:24,030
but your dad ended it

1371
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:28,161
as soon as your mother confronted
him about us.

1372
01:25:28,236 --> 01:25:31,171
And I just always wanted
you to know that.

1373
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,233
I don't mean to open old wounds, but...

1374
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:38,108
I just really needed to
say that I'm sorry.

1375
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,275
No, I'm really glad that
you said something.

1376
01:25:42,384 --> 01:25:45,080
You were always a really good friend.

1377
01:25:45,253 --> 01:25:47,881
I just wish I could've
returned the favor.

1378
01:25:48,256 --> 01:25:51,919
The lilies were bad, so I
got sunflowers instead.

1379
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:03,931
I wanted to tell you.

1380
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,131
You knew?

1381
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:08,375
You knew the whole time?

1382
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:11,742
I'm sorry. Don't talk to me.

1383
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:14,782
Paige. Paige. Paige!

1384
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,550
Hey, where have you been
all day, stranger?

1385
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:22,621
Hmm?

1386
01:26:22,924 --> 01:26:24,118
Paige?

1387
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:27,957
I ran into Diane Chain at the store.

1388
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:34,001
That's why I left, isn't
it? Because I found out.

1389
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:39,337
Mom, I barely even know who I am,

1390
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:41,807
and then it turns out
you're lying to me,

1391
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:45,346
and you've used my accident
to rewrite the past?

1392
01:26:47,349 --> 01:26:49,977
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you again.

1393
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:54,582
Do you have any idea how betrayed
I feel right now?

1394
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:56,647
I'm sorry, Paige.

1395
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:58,988
We were happier than
we'd been in years.

1396
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,288
Oh, Mom!

1397
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:01,954
We finally had you back again.

1398
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,292
Back on your terms!

1399
01:27:03,365 --> 01:27:04,525
No!

1400
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:06,794
Yes, as usual! Paige!

1401
01:27:06,868 --> 01:27:09,996
He cheated on you with my friend!

1402
01:27:11,172 --> 01:27:13,436
How could you stay with him?

1403
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:15,935
I...

1404
01:27:18,513 --> 01:27:20,606
I was going to leave.

1405
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:24,943
I was. I was all ready to leave.

1406
01:27:25,654 --> 01:27:29,954
And then one afternoon, I was
all alone in the house,

1407
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:35,521
and I started looking at all
the photographs of you

1408
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:37,858
and your...

1409
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:41,798
And your sister.

1410
01:27:42,504 --> 01:27:46,964
And the house seemed so
full of all of us.

1411
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:51,405
We were a family, Paige.

1412
01:27:53,014 --> 01:27:55,676
And I realized in that moment that

1413
01:27:56,384 --> 01:28:00,013
that was the most important
thing in the world for me.

1414
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:03,255
And I couldn't, I couldn't,

1415
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,552
I could not go.

1416
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:11,227
So, you just WASPed it away?

1417
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:12,825
No.

1418
01:28:13,768 --> 01:28:17,204
I chose to stay with him

1419
01:28:18,373 --> 01:28:21,501
for all the things that
he had done right

1420
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:27,171
and not to leave him for the one
thing that he had done wrong.

1421
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:32,710
I chose to forgive him.

1422
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:40,458
Maybe Leo was right.

1423
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:46,226
Maybe I can't figure out who I
am and be around all of you.

1424
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:03,284
I still feel a little chilly.
I don't care what you say.

1425
01:29:04,653 --> 01:29:06,120
That's fine.

1426
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:09,582
Paige.

1427
01:29:17,499 --> 01:29:18,727
I'm sorry.

1428
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,926
Is everything okay?

1429
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:26,331
Look, you two obviously need
to talk, so I'm just...

1430
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:27,931
Okay. Talk to you later.

1431
01:29:28,009 --> 01:29:29,636
All right, bye.

1432
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,009
I'm... I'm sorry.

1433
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:37,576
What happened?

1434
01:29:40,155 --> 01:29:41,417
Can I ask you something?

1435
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:42,683
Yeah.

1436
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:46,124
You can always ask me anything.

1437
01:29:46,795 --> 01:29:49,423
Did you know about my dad's affair?

1438
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:51,959
Yeah.

1439
01:29:52,634 --> 01:29:53,931
I knew.

1440
01:30:00,308 --> 01:30:01,969
Why didn't you tell me?

1441
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:12,675
There were so many times
that I almost did.

1442
01:30:15,356 --> 01:30:18,450
But to drive you away from
your family again?

1443
01:30:19,194 --> 01:30:20,821
That just felt wrong.

1444
01:30:22,897 --> 01:30:24,797
I wanted your love, I...

1445
01:30:24,866 --> 01:30:26,697
Just not like that.

1446
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:29,834
I wanted to earn it.

1447
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:49,349
I just don't think I can afford
to lose them right now.

1448
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:53,592
So don't.

1449
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:05,004
Certain parties have sought to nullify
various congressional acts,

1450
01:31:05,073 --> 01:31:07,906
claiming that repeated extensions
of copyright protection

1451
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:10,102
constitute a perpetual copyright

1452
01:31:10,211 --> 01:31:14,204
of the sort the drafters of the
Constitution would have rejected.

1453
01:31:14,282 --> 01:31:15,772
The United States Supreme Court,

1454
01:31:15,884 --> 01:31:19,012
in the 2003 case of Eldred
v. Ashcroft...

1455
01:31:26,728 --> 01:31:28,093
Thanks for lunch.

1456
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:31,757
Actually, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

1457
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:33,026
Okay.

1458
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,403
Things are over with Rose.

1459
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:39,402
I ended it, Paige.

1460
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,972
No. Why did you do that?

1461
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:44,874
I thought you were getting engaged...

1462
01:31:44,946 --> 01:31:46,538
We were, but that was before you.

1463
01:31:46,614 --> 01:31:48,081
No, that was after me.

1464
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:50,310
Okay, it was after you, but
it was before this you.

1465
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:52,283
It was before the old you came back.

1466
01:31:54,289 --> 01:31:56,450
Jeremy, I'm not the old me.

1467
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:59,151
I'm just me.

1468
01:31:59,627 --> 01:32:02,824
I'm just the me that's trying
to figure it out still.

1469
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:05,062
I understand, but, whichever it is,

1470
01:32:05,133 --> 01:32:08,068
the old you or the new
you, I don't care.

1471
01:32:09,771 --> 01:32:11,068
I know you remember what
we were like together.

1472
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:12,231
I know you do.

1473
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:13,774
This is our chance to get that back.

1474
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:15,432
What we had was wonderful.

1475
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:18,070
Those were wonderful memories,
but those were...

1476
01:32:18,146 --> 01:32:20,239
Those are my only memories.

1477
01:32:20,315 --> 01:32:22,681
Everything after you is erased.

1478
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:24,813
I...

1479
01:32:26,654 --> 01:32:31,853
I have to discover what it's like
to be without you, on my own.

1480
01:32:34,362 --> 01:32:35,488
Are you sure you don't remember

1481
01:32:35,597 --> 01:32:37,292
breaking up with me the first time?

1482
01:32:38,132 --> 01:32:39,531
Why?

1483
01:32:39,634 --> 01:32:41,932
'Cause it sounded a hell
of a lot like that.

1484
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:47,606
Let's go.

1485
01:32:58,353 --> 01:33:01,117
Hey. I was looking all over.

1486
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:05,057
I was worried when I didn't see
you outside the library.

1487
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:08,891
So...

1488
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:14,896
How's that intellectual
property class going?

1489
01:33:20,475 --> 01:33:23,376
Actually, I wanna talk
to you about that.

1490
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:27,047
I've decided to leave law school.

1491
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:31,144
And I'm gonna get an apartment
in the city.

1492
01:33:32,053 --> 01:33:34,544
It's happening all over
again, isn't it?

1493
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,351
Damn it, Paige.

1494
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:39,383
I've made a lot of mistakes.

1495
01:33:40,194 --> 01:33:44,392
Dad, this isn't about you
or anything you've done.

1496
01:33:44,999 --> 01:33:49,265
This is about me, who I
want to be, who I am.

1497
01:33:50,505 --> 01:33:55,169
Just tell me what to say, so
I don't lose you again.

1498
01:33:58,513 --> 01:34:00,105
You won't.

1499
01:34:08,222 --> 01:34:10,383
A moment of impact.

1500
01:34:16,431 --> 01:34:20,731
A moment of impact whose
potential for change

1501
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:24,260
has ripple effects far beyond
what we can predict,

1502
01:34:27,475 --> 01:34:30,376
sending some particles
crashing together

1503
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:34,913
making them closer than before,

1504
01:34:41,422 --> 01:34:44,653
while sending others spinning
off into great ventures

1505
01:34:47,595 --> 01:34:50,826
landing where you never thought
you'd find them.

1506
01:34:54,402 --> 01:34:57,803
You see, that's the thing
about moments like these.

1507
01:34:58,673 --> 01:35:00,334
You can't,

1508
01:35:01,175 --> 01:35:03,439
no matter how hard you try,

1509
01:35:04,178 --> 01:35:06,908
control how they're gonna affect you.

1510
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:12,413
You just gotta let the colliding
particles land where they may

1511
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:17,517
and wait until the next collision.

1512
01:35:25,466 --> 01:35:28,435
I vow to help you love life,

1513
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,869
to always hold you with tenderness,

1514
01:35:30,972 --> 01:35:33,839
and to have the patience
that love demands.

1515
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:36,034
To speak when words are needed

1516
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:38,806
and to share the silence
when they're not.

1517
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,441
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.

1518
01:35:43,151 --> 01:35:45,449
And to live within the
warmth of your heart

1519
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,147
and always call it home.

1520
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:34,526
Hi.

1521
01:36:37,505 --> 01:36:38,904
Hi.

1522
01:36:42,343 --> 01:36:44,106
I hope you didn't come all the way

1523
01:36:44,212 --> 01:36:45,577
into the city for hot chocolate.

1524
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,377
Actually, I moved back
here six months ago.

1525
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:51,543
I'm over in Rogers Park.

1526
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:55,379
Really? That... That's great.

1527
01:36:55,456 --> 01:36:57,890
I'm actually back at the Art Institute.

1528
01:36:57,959 --> 01:36:59,517
What? Are you kidding me?

1529
01:36:59,694 --> 01:37:00,752
Mmm-mmm.

1530
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:02,022
That's amazing.

1531
01:37:02,096 --> 01:37:05,031
Yeah. I mean, I'm sitting
in on a few classes,

1532
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,467
and it's crazy what my hands remember

1533
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:12,539
that my, you know, that my mind forgot.

1534
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:14,972
Yeah.

1535
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,105
So, thank you.

1536
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,247
I didn't do anything.

1537
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:23,146
You did everything.

1538
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:27,817
You accepted me for who I am,

1539
01:37:28,623 --> 01:37:31,421
and not for what you wanted me to be.

1540
01:37:35,096 --> 01:37:37,428
I just wanted you to be happy.

1541
01:37:39,433 --> 01:37:40,900
That's all.

1542
01:37:48,409 --> 01:37:51,469
Isn't there some Cuban
place around here

1543
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:55,413
where we used to go when
this place was closed?

1544
01:37:57,151 --> 01:38:00,143
Yeah. It's... Wait. You remember?

1545
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:02,182
No, no.

1546
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:04,989
I wish.

1547
01:38:05,426 --> 01:38:09,453
No, the memory stuff hasn't
come back, but I've...

1548
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:13,327
Sonia and I have been hanging
out a little bit,

1549
01:38:13,434 --> 01:38:17,268
and I've been asking her about us.

1550
01:38:19,006 --> 01:38:21,634
Really? And what has she been saying?

1551
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:26,045
That she doesn't think you're

1552
01:38:26,147 --> 01:38:27,842
seeing anyone right now.

1553
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:33,514
She just happens to be right.

1554
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:39,391
You? Are you seeing anyone?

1555
01:38:44,865 --> 01:38:46,560
That's good.

1556
01:38:47,001 --> 01:38:50,698
So, do you wanna go to the Cuban place?

1557
01:38:51,639 --> 01:38:53,004
With me?

1558
01:38:54,675 --> 01:38:56,165
Okay.

1559
01:38:56,844 --> 01:38:58,209
Okay.

1560
01:39:01,849 --> 01:39:03,316
What would you say to trying someplace

1561
01:39:03,384 --> 01:39:05,215
that we haven't been to before?

1562
01:39:05,319 --> 01:39:07,014
Someplace new?

1563
01:39:07,922 --> 01:39:09,583
I'd like that.

1564
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:11,390
