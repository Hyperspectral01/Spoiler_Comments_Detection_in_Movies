Hear anything?

7

There's gotta be other
people out here, other villages.

8

9

00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,067
You found something.

105
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:43,558
It was in a clearing, which I
found a with little help from...

106
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:47,316
Hm, Heihei, but this
isn't from our village.

107
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:50,359
I don't even know what
it's made of, but it's proof.

108
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:53,942
There are other people out there.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,817
I don't know why we haven't
found them yet, but Dad -

110
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:02,292
that island, I think that's
where they're going to be

111
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,734
I just have to figure out
how to find those stars.

112
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,184
Little sis!

113
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:11,484

114
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:12,484

00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,484
Big sis!

116
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,442
I thought you were gone forever.

117
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,983
It was three days, but
I missed you every...

118
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:21,984
What did you bring me?

119
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,650
Bring you?

120
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,567
You said you'd bring me a present.

121
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:25,909
Hmm.

122
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:27,317
Well, let me see.

123
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,484
Whoa.

124
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:32,192
What's it do?

125
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:33,984
What's it dr-r!

126
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,775
Where are we going?

127
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,867
This is a place of our ancestors,

128
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:52,053
where I learned our people are voyagers.

129
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,983
Where Grandma showed me who we are.

130
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:59,441
Gramma. She said to grab
Maui by the ear and tell him,

131
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:01,900
I am a Moana of Motunui.

132
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,567
You'll board my boat and
restore the heart of Ta-Fiti.

133
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:06,984
Pretty good.

134
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,150
Yeah.

135
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,859
How long did it take?

136
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,009
Uh, a few weeks.

137
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:14,484
Weeks? That's longer than forever.

138
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,150
I know, but it was important.

139
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,475
And if I hadn't gone,

140
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,160
I never would have become a wayfinder.

141
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:25,509
Like our ancient chiefs,

142
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,335
like the last great navigator, Taotai Vasa.

143
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:34,234
Before Maui stole Ta-Fiti's
heart and we stopped voyaging,

144
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,692
Taotai Vasa wanted to connect our island

145
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:41,476
to all the people of the entire ocean.

146
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,750
Because together, what we can do,

147
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:49,460
how far we all can go, it's endless.

148
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:52,725
And now that I'm a wayfinder,

149
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:57,076
it's my job to continue what he started.

150
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,900
And this - this is my first clue how.

151
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,984
You should make Maui
go so you can stay with me.

152
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,717
Well, Maui's out demigodding,

153
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,043
but if he ever shows up,

154
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,050
you will grab him by
the ear and tell him that.

155
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:27,284
Woohoo.

156
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:53,208
Woo-hoo. I'm not here to cause trouble.

157
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:57,924
Just a super chiseled
demigod passing through.

158
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:02,009
Now open the portal to the
island and I'll be on my way.

159
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,859
And why would I risk
breaking the rules for you

160
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:10,900
when you've already caused
my boss so much trouble?

161
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:12,783
Hey, Nalo started it.

162
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,025
And you'll finish it?

163
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,484
Team up with your precious human again?

164
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,258
Team? You mean the girl with the canoe

165
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,736
and that goofy little chicken?

166
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:27,109
We weren't a team. I just
used her to get my hook.

167
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:29,609
Ow - Ow!

168
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:32,583
Nalo is a god, Maui.

169
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:35,324
If you try to reconnect
the people of the ocean,

170
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:36,794
he will destroy you.

171
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,650
And then he'll destroy her too.

172
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,942
This is between him and me.

173
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,567
Moana has nothing to do with it.

174
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:49,817
Only you made her a wayfinder, Maui.

175
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:55,067
So now, she has everything to do with it.

176
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,784
Is this it? Whoa...

177
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:11,483
I'd like a sample of that.

178
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:13,483
Moana should stop being coy.

179
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,484
Ooah - ooah...

180
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:20,484
(Here you are)

181
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:37,983
Well, eat up.

182
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:40,067
We don't want the pork getting cold.

183
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,484
Maybe not...

184
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:46,317
Moana.

185
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,817
Tonight isn't just a feast.

186
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Long ago,

187
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,817
there was a title given to
the last great wayfinder.

188
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,025
With dreams as big as yours.

189
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,400
The sacred title...

190
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:01,942
More than a chief,

191
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:03,775
A Tautai.

192
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,317
Leader, connector of the entire sea.

193
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:08,984
My dear,

194
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:13,234
would you honor us tonight
by accepting this title?

195
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:17,400
Our people's first Tautai
in a thousand years.

196
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,524
And show us all

197
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,275
just how far we'll go.

198
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:46,775
Tonight, we drink from our ancestors' foam.

199
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,400
As Tautai Vasa once did.

200
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,484
To bestow this title on you.

201
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,692
To connect to our past.

202
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,192
Our present.

203
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:59,900
And the future that lies beyond.

204
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,484
May the ancestors continue to guide us.

205
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,484
Big sis.

206
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:19,484
I am honored to serve our people.

207
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:25,109
May the ancestors continue to guide us.

208
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:48,484
Tautai Vasa...

209
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:53,525
Motufetu should be under the stars.

210
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:04,549
(INDISTINCT VOICES)

211
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,775
Where are my people?

212
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,650
Tautai Moana.

213
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:52,400
This is your future if
you cannot find others.

214
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:57,609
In isolation, this is how your story ends.

215
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,192
I don't understand.

216
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,775
Returning Ta-Fiti's
heart was the beginning.

217
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,192
You must brave the storm.

218
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,275
Reconnect our people.

219
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,984
Find Motufetu.

220
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,442
I don't know how to reach it.

221
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:15,524
A fire in the sky will guide you.

222
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,400
Wait, I don't even know how far it is.

223
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,650
Farther than I was able to go.

224
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,317
Find Motufetu.

225
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:29,542
Reconnect us all.

226
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:40,859
Motufetu!

227
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:46,484
The island I have to find is Motufetu.

228
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:49,267
Okay. It took some searching, but...

229
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,050
Motufetu.

230
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:55,484
What is it?

231
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,549
An ancient island where the channels

232
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,636
of the ocean once came together,

233
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,249
connecting the people of the entire sea

234
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,250
until it was lost, cursed.

235
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,000
Cursed?

236
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,775
In a terrible storm from a
power-hungry god, Nalo.

237
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:24,441
He believed he'd be stronger by separating

238
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:27,744
the people of the ocean to weaken us

239
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:29,942
to end our story.

240
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,667
Our ancestors believed reaching Motufetu

241
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,552
would break Nalo's curse.

242
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Restore the channels.

243
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,567
It's the only way to bring
our people together again.

244
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,317
Or our story ends.

245
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,983
We need to convene a council of...

246
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:53,484
Chief!

247
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:15,692
A fire in the sky.

248
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,234
He wants me to follow it.

249
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,025
To new stars?

250
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,275
It could take a lifetime.

251
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,275
Tautai Vasa didn't make it back at all.

252
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,692
It's a call from the ancestors, Tui.

253
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,900
But if we never see her again, ah...

254
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,984
What do you mean, never see you again?

255
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:37,650
Simea, no, I - I mean that's...

256
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,984
I don't want you to leave!

257
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:53,609
Mom, it's...

258
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:57,067
It's so fast. What if...

259
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,317
You're a Tautai now, Moana.

260
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,942
For some things...

261
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:05,942

It's not like last time.

304
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,442
Last time you weren't
old enough to understand.

305
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:24,484
Oh, you could lose or learn.

306
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,817
But here we are, together
still. Just a little different.

307
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,150
I can't see where your story leads.

308
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,650
But we never stop choosing who we are.

This is bigger than Motunui.

310
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,567
Bigger than us.

311
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,550
So I will sail to this new sky

312
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:55,478
to reconnect the people
of the entire ocean.

313
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:59,400

Heihei and Pua don't count.

325
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,400
It's the other side of the ocean.

326
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,149
How could I ask them to?

327
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,234
Our people will rise if you let them.

328
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,109
Last time the chicken made it.

329
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,317
Well, then I'm going
to need a bigger canoe.

330
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,608
Oho, yes, brand new.

331
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:07,117
Sweet!

332
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:07,842
Double hull design.

333
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:09,209
My fist can do this.

334
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:09,859
Wait...

335
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:11,483
Top of the line upgrades
for the crew, right?

336
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,442
Loto, I'd like you on the crew.

337
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,009
Oh. Well, we should do better than this.

338
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:24,274
A farmer on the sea.

339
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,915
We're going to need more than fish.

340
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,484
You need irrigation.

341
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,150
Plant propagation.

342
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,109
Take even my best apprentice.

343
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:32,525
You'd starve.

344
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:33,300
Exactly.

345
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:34,609
We need a master.

346
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:35,817
Yes, you do need a...

347
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,067
Thanks, Kele.

348
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,075
You're the best!

349
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I walked into that one.

350
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,359
Hey, Maui. It's, uh, been a while.

351
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,075
Um, I don't know where you are,

352
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,984
but, whoo, I could really use your help.

353
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:53,234
Maui!

354
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:54,942
Oh, Moni.

355
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:57,109
It's both of us, actually.

356
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,567
Maui and me.

357
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:01,775
It's part of a series.

358
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,609
Wow...

359
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,025
It's too bad Maui isn't here.

360
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:09,255
We really need someone
who knows all the old stories.

361
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:12,616
Someone who's like super strong

362
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:15,126
and has great hair and just -

363
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:16,668
I think I know someone else

364
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:17,817
kind of like that?

365
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:20,317
Huh - Yes!

366
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:24,109
I'm going with Moana on
a call from the ancestors.

367
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Whoo!

368
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,775
Get ready for some
eyewitness accounts, people.

369
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm coming with you.

370
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,525
I'll be back as soon as I can.

371
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,359
I promise.

372
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:50,942
What if you don't come back?

373
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:02,275
The ocean is my friend.

374
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,317
Our friend.

375
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:35,692
It connects us.

376
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:45,633
So, there is nowhere I could ever go

377
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:48,120
that I won't be with you.

378
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:49,184
Go.

379
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,067
So you can take a piece from home.

380
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:21,384
You might want to hold on.

381
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:31,483
Okay, okay, okay.

382
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:32,484
One more time.

383
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,025
This is not the end of our story.

384
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,067
This is not where our destiny is denied.

385
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:44,150
Together, we rise as one!

386
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,550
Together, we take our freedom!

387
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:54,858
That guy gets it.

388
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,317
Yep, I mean you, handsome.

389
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,734
Now all you gotta do is catch my hook.

390
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:03,317
Come on.

391
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:06,692
Yes, yes.

392
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,042
Come on, you got it.

393
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,450
That's what I'm talking about.

394
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:10,984
Yes, keep doing it.

395
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,484
That's it, higher.

396
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,342
We're almost there.

397
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Just a little higher.

398
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:32,992
Don't worry.

399
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,050
Come on, you know
me, I'll get us out of here.

400
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,609
No, I don't need her to save me...

401
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
again.

402
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:42,692
Because she'll die.

403
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,650
Malo hates humans even
more than he hates me.

404
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,026
And let me tell you something.

405
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,150
He hates me a lot.

406
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:51,484
So the farther Curly is
from any of this, the better.

407
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:55,317
We're on our own.

408
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:58,442
Haha, yeah, I got it.

409
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,325
I would let you out, but

410
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,403
I'm really hoping to
meet your little friend.

411
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:08,025
I have plans for you both.

412
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:13,192
- Hey - hey!
- Enjoy your lunch.

413
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:36,984
Loto! What are you doing?

414
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:38,484
Making improvements.

415
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:39,209
Okay.

416
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,192
The canoe is perfect as it is.

417
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:44,567
Perfection's a myth.

418
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:47,567
There is only failing,
then learning, then death.

419
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,150
Moni, the oar?

420
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,525
Of course.

421
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,484
That's why you're the wayfinder.

422
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,192
No, no, no.

423
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,692
Ow! Guys, the entire ocean
is kind of counting on us.

424
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,484
We've got to rise to the moment.

425
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:10,234
Stay on course and keep
everyone on the canoe.

426
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:12,692
Wait, where's the farmer?

427
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:14,984
Ow.

428
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,942
When will the canoe stop moving?

429
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:20,275
Well, we're kind of on the ocean.

430
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:22,566
Oh, Moni.

431
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,484
Loto. Moni's the other one.

432
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,417
Guys, we'll never make it - Woo!

433
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,050
What?

434
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:31,067
If you don't embrace the ocean.

435
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,218
You can't embrace a liquid.

436
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:33,483
Also, I cannot swim.

437
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,524
- Aw!
- Now everyone looks sad.

438
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,483
And whoever designed
the canoe forgot a bathroom.

439
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:52,775
I am unclear as to what you are doing.

440
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,609
Guys, we want to reach
Motufetu, break Nalo's curse.

441
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,483
We gotta come together!

442
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,483
Find our rhythm!

443
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,483
I don't need anyone!

444
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:05,483

Let me give you a correction
even though the song is clever.

484
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:34,983
The answer to your question
"What could possibly be better"

485
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:36,483
Technically speaking, perfection's a myth.

486
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,483
Even though the journey's
epic, something better could exist.

487
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,983
But that's why I'm
always designing, aligning.

488
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,483
Combining ideas, and always refining.

489
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,483
I'm a real bright thinker
and a genius when I tinker.

490
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:45,483
With a love of problem-solving
as a model canoe sinker.

491
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,483
We're failing fantastically,
yes, we're a mess.

492
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,583
And we're messing up drastically,
falling on your face is the best.

493
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,483
If you do it wrong, then
you run another test.

494
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:52,983
Yes, it's really simple, actually.

495
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:54,483
The motto of Loto until
her very last breath.

496
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:56,684

00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:15,983
I'm sure this happened for a reason.

513
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,484
Yeah, it's probably a good thing, right?

514
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:23,483
One of you, grab the oar!

515
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:26,483
I'm trying. Something's
wrong with the canoe!

516
00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:28,484
It's not the canoe.

517
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:29,783
It's the current.

518
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:30,784
What?

519
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:34,483
Hey, ocean...

520
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:37,483
it's not like I want to
give an odd impression

521
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:38,683
other than follow the comet.

522
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:41,684
So it's not like we need a new course...

523
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:49,484
Land!

524
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:51,984
Motufetu.

525
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,484
We found it - really quickly.

526
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:58,484
Are those people?

527
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:02,984
That's no island...

528
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:09,484
And those aren't a people - Kakamora.

529
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:15,484
Wenano!

530
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:34,484
Oh, we're cursed. About
to be skewered by coconuts.

531
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:38,484
Good, they're just ignoring us.

532
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:09,484
Okay. You guys... Down in the hold.

533
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:24,183
- Ahaha!
- She's using centrifugal force

534
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,184
to make her way around them - Moana!

535
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:39,484
Ha - Bu-Bye! Thanks for the ride.

536
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:55,484
Bring it on, coco... nuts.

537
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:14,484
Hey, you will release
us! Right - right... right?

538
00:38:33,484 --> 00:38:36,484
Waa - What is happening?

539
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:50,484
Uh, that is... um, fan fic.

540
00:38:51,484 --> 00:38:53,983
I think they know that you drew it

541
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:57,484
but they want you to
translate that picture.

542
00:38:57,984 --> 00:39:01,984
Ahaha. Oh, um...

543
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:06,484
Your home island...

544
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:10,884
Is in the same sea as Motufetu.

545
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:14,483
And when Nalo divided the ocean

546
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:16,484
to weaken the people of the sea

547
00:39:17,484 --> 00:39:20,484
your ancestors were
disconnected from their home.

548
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:25,883
But you thought you
finally found a way back

549
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,984
when you ran into this giant clam.

550
00:39:28,484 --> 00:39:33,484
And now you're worried
you'll stay separated forever.

551
00:39:35,484 --> 00:39:37,484
This whole time...

552
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,484
They've just been trying to get home.

553
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:47,683
Wait. If we help you defeat the clam,

554
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:53,484
you'll help us reach Motufetu - together.

555
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:58,483
Yoo-hoo. Could you tell me
how we're going to beat that?

556
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:01,484
When we can't even wiggle a finger?

557
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:04,483
You went from a puzzle
on to a miracle. That's cool.

558
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:07,183
Wait, wait. I know. We could

559
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,483
use the liquid from one giant mussel.

560
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:10,483
If we get close enough with that stuff,

561
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:11,484
shoot it in the ganglia.

562
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:14,483
It's goodbye clam, hello Motufetu.

563
00:40:14,484 --> 00:40:16,984
Huh - Do you think that'll work?

564
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:25,983
Oh. You want us to do it.

565
00:40:25,984 --> 00:40:28,984
It'd be easier if we're not jelly.

566
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:32,483
Ooh, don't worry. They can fix that.

567
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:33,484
How?

568
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:41,984
What is that?

569
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,708
Eww - Mmm!

570
00:40:57,484 --> 00:41:02,484
Alright - Oh, ho ho
ho. Tastes like coconut.

571
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,560
Oh, I know what a coconut does.

572
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:07,984
Okay. Where do we get
some toxin for the clam?

573
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:16,484
A dream from both ends.

574
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:26,484
Come on. We gotta go.

575
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:42,483
We made a deal. We take out the clam

576
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:46,483
and then you're helping us get to Motufetu!

577
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,484
Uh! You are so vain.

578
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:05,484
Oh, I think it's a warrior's
salute to show us respect.

579
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:13,984
Goodbye, end quote.

580
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:24,283
How do we shoot the ganglia

581
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:26,236
if we don't know what it looks like?

582
00:42:26,484 --> 00:42:27,783
I think we're going to know

583
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:30,484
what a ganglia looks like when we see it.

584
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:39,484
So, I just "Bee-Boop" and
Motufetu, here we come?

585
00:42:40,484 --> 00:42:41,484
Mission accomplished.

586
00:42:46,884 --> 00:42:48,883
Oh, no - Ahh!

587
00:42:48,884 --> 00:42:52,884
And this is why you always
have a backup. Woo?

588
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:56,084
And a third. Ah!

589
00:42:57,984 --> 00:42:59,984
Well, a fourth would be lunacy.

590
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,484
No - We gotta get out!

591
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:03,484
Wait. What are you do - Ahh!

592
00:44:42,484 --> 00:44:47,083
Moana - Moana? ((Moana))

593
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,084
Concur on the echo.

594
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:53,484
Kakamora, you did this!

595
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:01,984
I may have made an assumption there.

596
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:23,234
Fascinating. It's like an acid.

597
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,484
Can I get a chihu?

598
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,484
Oh, yeah!

599
00:45:41,484 --> 00:45:45,900
Ohaha - Now I just gotta get my baby.

600
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,484
Maui-i-i?

601
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:00,483
The tattoo of Maui.

602
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:03,692
Listen to me. I am a demigod.

603
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:06,116
- Woo? Oh, ho-ho-ha-ha.
- I want to be slapped by the tattoo.

604
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:09,159
Hey! Okay. Rule number one.

605
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,150
Okay.

606
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:14,974
Uh, roll me back.

607
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:15,877
I'll roll you back.

608
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:17,077
No, no, no. Not him.

609
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,900
This is what happens
when you meet your heroes.

610
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,067
Uhh! I know, right?

611
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:26,683
Ah! Okay, rule number one.

612
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:28,684
You never saw me like this.

613
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,908
Even though I still look very cool.

614
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:32,069
You look like a kidney stone.

615
00:46:32,484 --> 00:46:34,483
And you look like someone
who would know what that is.

616
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:35,484
Now.

617
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:42,733
Well, hello, bacon.
Okay. I feel like there's

618
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,067
some back story that I
need to get caught up on.

619
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:47,341
Oh! Actually, you know what? Scratch that.

620
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:50,169
I don't want to get attached if you all...

621
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:51,267
You know what I mean?

622
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:52,769
Which... which... you guys won't.

623
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:53,658
You're not gonna do that.

624
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:54,835
I don't even know why I said that.

625
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:57,859
The point is, there's some
serious god stuff going down.

626
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,934
And I know how to handle this one.

627
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,009
Alright. Be back in a bit.

628
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:17,433
Until then, stay alive. Talk to no one.

629
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:20,859
And if you see a crazy bat
lady, run. She is the worst.

630
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,359
Stay away or you will die. Be good.

631
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:24,942
Maui, out.

632
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:29,275
- Boat snack!
- Boat snack...

633
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,900
Where's Moana?

634
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,734
Simea? Simea!

635
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:45,900
Oh, how are you here?

636
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:50,683
I'm not. You got sucked inside a giant clam

637
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:53,283
and your story will end, 'cause now

638
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:56,575
you will never help
the people of the ocean.

639
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:58,408
And the ancestors will be like

640
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:03,409
"Moana, we hate you
forever and ever and ever..."

641
00:48:25,984 --> 00:48:29,667
You got this. Yeah. You got this.

642
00:48:29,684 --> 00:48:32,350
You got this.

643
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:36,192
Relax. I don't bite.

644
00:48:37,067 --> 00:48:38,067
Hizzer might.

645
00:48:38,484 --> 00:48:42,317
It's been a while since
I've seen a wayfinder.

646
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:44,575
Love the oar.

647
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:46,469
Would you like to see me use it?

648
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:51,045
Ooh, feisty. We have that in common, Moana.

649
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:56,118
The human who's got all the gods talking.

650
00:48:57,942 --> 00:48:59,124
Who are you?

651
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:03,119
Matani, guardian of
this little slice of paradise.

652
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,484
You live here?

653
00:49:07,817 --> 00:49:11,484
Not by choice. Maui never mentioned me?

654
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,483
Ha! Probably too busy
playing with his tattoo.

655
00:49:16,984 --> 00:49:19,400
Well, come on then.

656
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:23,317
Um, I'm not going anywhere
with you. I need to...

657
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:27,025
Get out of here, break
Nalo's curse, find Motufetu.

658
00:49:28,017 --> 00:49:29,017
Here to help.

659
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,460
You know the way to Motufetu?

660
00:49:31,484 --> 00:49:34,359
You think you can only get
somewhere if you know the way?

661
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,317
That's kind of what way finding is.

662
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:40,984
Ah. So much to learn.

663
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:48,184
A true wayfinder doesn't
know the path at all.

664
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,425
That's the whole point.

665
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:53,568
To find your way to
what's never been found.

666
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:55,584
If you want to break Nalo's curse,

667
00:49:55,608 --> 00:49:57,235
you've got to stop playing it safe, sis.

668
00:49:58,359 --> 00:49:59,859
Get a little lost.

669
00:50:00,817 --> 00:50:02,775
Why would I listen to anything you say?

670
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:06,192
Because Nalo trapped me too.

671
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:12,442
I want you to beat Nalo.

00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:22,192
What are you gonna do?

721
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:26,692
Get lost.

722
00:53:30,484 --> 00:53:32,484
Get lost!

723
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:48,984
Oh.

724
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,109
There's always another way.

725
00:53:58,859 --> 00:53:59,859
Portal of the gods.

726
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:03,567
It won't get you all the way to Motufetu

727
00:54:03,942 --> 00:54:06,442
but it'll shorten the commute
for you and your crew.

728
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:08,775
And Mr. Coconut Oil.

729
00:54:09,484 --> 00:54:10,609
Who's Mr...

730
00:54:11,484 --> 00:54:13,984
Oh. Always losing my patience.

731
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,484
Maui!

732
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:18,535
Do not fear. You have been rescued. Woo!

733
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,692
Kowa-ki-na, kowa-ki-na!

734
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,917
Mueha, Mueha - Mui

735
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:35,067
She opened it?

736
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:49,858
This was your plan?

737
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,715
Keep me in a snot cave because

738
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:53,015
you wanted us to go together?

739
00:54:53,016 --> 00:54:55,591
Well, I certainly did not
keep you for the conversation.

740
00:54:56,317 --> 00:54:57,317
Oh, wait.

741
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:00,359
Well, shall we?

742
00:55:04,025 --> 00:55:05,567
You can't leave?

743
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:07,775
Break Nalo's curse

744
00:55:08,484 --> 00:55:11,317
and maybe one day
we'll see each other again.

745
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:15,442
Remember there's always another way

746
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:19,025
Even if you have to get lost to find it.

747
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:21,109
Good luck, Tautai Moana.

748
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:24,274
You got this.

749
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:36,192
Hmm. If Nalo finds out I
helped we'll die by lightning.

750
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:37,775
Maui looked good.

751
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:43,859
- Woo!
- I'm kissing the pig!

752
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,942
We're in a portal of the gods!

753
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:48,134
Hey!

754
00:55:48,317 --> 00:55:49,442
Hey guys!

755
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,900
Together again!

756
00:55:51,192 --> 00:55:52,192
Plus Maui?

757
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:53,359
Where's Maui?

758
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,725
What's up, Curly?

759
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:55,942
Maui!

760
00:55:57,484 --> 00:56:00,067
You could have told me
we were doing new outfits.

761
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:02,717
I've been rocking leaves on
my cheeks for a thousand years.

762
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,634
Oh... I can't believe you're here!

763
00:56:04,692 --> 00:56:08,250
Hey buddy, I missed ya! Yeah.

764
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:10,233
Oh! Um, sorry. That was weird.

765
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:11,234
Was that weird?

766
00:56:11,817 --> 00:56:13,609
It's the greatest day of my life.

767
00:56:15,317 --> 00:56:18,066
Love this guy! Not creeping me out at all.

768
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:19,534
Can I talk to you for a second?

769
00:56:20,317 --> 00:56:22,109
This is Pua.

770
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:23,608
Oh! And did you meet the kakamora?

771
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:24,974
I thought he'd lose us in the clam

772
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:26,433
but he turned out to be super great

773
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:29,099
because otherwise I never
would have met Matani

774
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,067
Who's great by the way

775
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:30,817
And now you!

776
00:56:30,859 --> 00:56:33,259
And now we're gonna bring
the whole world together...

777
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,760
Sorry, you go.

778
00:56:35,317 --> 00:56:36,942
You're all gonna die.

779
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:40,117
(Laughs) What?

780
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:41,885
What?

781
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:44,343
Nalo didn't just hide Motofetu in a storm.

782
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:46,510
He hid it in a monster storm

783
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:48,718
in a cursed ocean you can't escape from

784
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,219
and then sunk it to the bottom of the sea.

785
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:53,774
Which means a human can't reach it.

786
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:55,483
So unless I break the curse

787
00:56:55,484 --> 00:56:57,608
you just bought a one
way ticket to Deadsville.

788
00:56:57,609 --> 00:57:00,116
Which is why I didn't want
you coming out in the first place.

789
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,441
Because now you're
stuck and you're gonna die.

790
00:57:02,442 --> 00:57:03,733
Your crew's gonna die.

791
00:57:03,984 --> 00:57:06,242
And this time so is the chicken.

792
00:57:13,217 --> 00:57:15,224
But, it's great to see you.

793
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:17,317
And we're here.

794
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:30,317
Good one on me?

795
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:35,150
But this place looks perfectly nice.

796
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:38,917
And look. The constellation.

797
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:40,609
It's right there!

798
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:45,691
Guys, the ancestors wouldn't have called

799
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:47,192
if we couldn't do this.

800
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,484
Unless it was a butt dial.

801
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:50,984
That'll make sense in two thousand years.

802
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:53,274
Tautai Vasa said reaching Motufetu

803
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:56,233
is the only way to give
our people a future.

804
00:57:56,234 --> 00:57:57,275
If he knows so much,

805
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,984
how come he didn't tell
you it was ♪ sunk?

806
00:58:01,284 --> 00:58:05,150
Because he told me to
follow the fire in the sky.

807
00:58:05,317 --> 00:58:07,192
That led me straight to you.

808
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,109
Which makes sense

809
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:13,234
because if Nalo thinks he's
stronger by keeping people apart,

810
00:58:13,317 --> 00:58:17,067
then maybe the way to break
his curse is by coming together.

811
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:20,817
You lift the island and I step on it.

812
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,250
Maui and Moana! Together again.

813
00:58:23,317 --> 00:58:24,317
You're so amazing!

814
00:58:25,317 --> 00:58:26,425
This is gonna work.

815
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:30,109
Right, ocean? Ocean...

816
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:42,725
Moana. The ocean cannot help you here.

817
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:49,734
Grandma.

818
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:56,167
Actually, I believe that's a welcome gift

819
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:58,775
from Nalo.

820
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:19,876
Take that, sucker!

821
00:59:20,317 --> 00:59:24,017
Humans, get to your positions,
work together and let's do this!

822
00:59:26,317 --> 00:59:29,067
We really gotta talk about
your recruiting process.

823
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:31,184
Gramps!

824
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,734
Down below.

825
00:59:33,317 --> 00:59:34,650
Hate these guys.

826
00:59:35,317 --> 00:59:36,441
Hey, I'm an elder!

827
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:37,900
And I'm three thousand years old.

828
00:59:38,317 --> 00:59:39,984
Which makes me elder-er.

829
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,316
Just gotta outrun them till sunrise.

830
00:59:43,317 --> 00:59:44,984
Oh, then they're nocturnal.

831
00:59:45,317 --> 00:59:49,658
Uh, sure. Chi-hu!

832
00:59:50,984 --> 00:59:51,984
Oh, yeah!

833
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:02,625
Did he just wink at us? Woohoo!

834
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:06,525
Behind us.

835
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:11,109
If Moana can turn the tide
in this fish battle, it'll work!

836
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:15,317
Moana!

837
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,484
Moni!

838
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:23,983
Moana! AHH!

839
01:00:23,984 --> 01:00:25,984
Moni!

840
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:47,317
Moni!

841
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:56,984
Moni...

842
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:30,484
We'll figure this out.

843
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,900
May I speak to you, Moana?

844
01:01:42,017 --> 01:01:45,574
Tautai Vasa's canoe.

845
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:52,734
Uh, uh... Ah, it's a bad
time to say I told you so

846
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:54,636
so I'm not gonna do that

847
01:01:54,637 --> 01:01:56,197
because that would make you feel worse.

848
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:57,774
But I believe in you.

849
01:01:57,775 --> 01:01:58,899
No one else does.

850
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,983
There you go. Walk it off, champ.

851
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,275
What? I was being nice.

852
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:06,192
Ow - No purple, no, ow!

853
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:07,984
Okay, I'll talk to her.

854
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:18,567
I know, Maui. It's just

855
01:02:21,525 --> 01:02:26,042
Every time I think I know
what I'm supposed to do

856
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:28,993
everything changes.

857
01:02:29,317 --> 01:02:33,275
I can't... Moni almost died!

858
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:40,825
If I'm the reason our
people's story just ends...

859
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:45,067
This is serious!

860
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:46,734
Is something distracting you?

861
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:49,424
Maybe breaking the curse is like you said.

862
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:50,416
We gotta work together.

863
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:54,542
I pull it from the sea but a
human has to land on its shores.

864
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,933
Look, I get it.

865
01:03:01,934 --> 01:03:04,017
No one likes sucking at their job.

866
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:06,025
Why are you even here?

867
01:03:06,484 --> 01:03:11,650
Because. Because I've been low before.

868
01:03:12,317 --> 01:03:15,984
And I couldn't see a way forward.

869
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:19,275
And then someone came along.

870
01:03:20,317 --> 01:03:21,609
Someone who I underestimated.

871
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:25,025
And she lifted me up.

872
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:29,317
I haven't done anything right

873
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:31,650
since I left my island.

874
01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:35,817
Hey. There is a way out.

875
01:03:36,317 --> 01:03:37,433
You wanna get through it?

876
01:03:37,434 --> 01:03:40,252
You just gotta chi-hu it.

877
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,608
You are so bad at this.

878
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,274
I'm the best at this.

879
01:03:43,275 --> 01:03:46,859
I was a human, but now I'm a demigod.

880
01:03:47,317 --> 01:03:49,358
You never know what's next.

881
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,400
I do. Nalo's monster storm.

882
01:03:52,734 --> 01:03:54,024
Well, you wanna get through it?

883
01:03:54,025 --> 01:03:55,025

Still not a princess.

963
01:06:51,484 --> 01:06:53,357
Well, a lot of people think you are.

964
01:06:57,117 --> 01:07:02,925
Mm, I know what I've asked of you is a lot

965
01:07:03,317 --> 01:07:06,484
and our canoe is in really rough shape.

966
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:11,317
But I believe that together we...

967
01:07:31,609 --> 01:07:33,984
We found a way to fix it.

968
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:36,066
With a little help from the ancestors, man.

969
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:38,066
I did the decorations.

970
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:40,684
We used the chicken.

971
01:07:41,284 --> 01:07:42,784
Respect.

972
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,733
Nalo wants to end our story.

973
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:52,275
But we're not letting that happen.

974
01:07:52,317 --> 01:07:54,067
We just have to outsmart him.

975
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:56,399
Find a new trick he's never seen before.

976
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,150
Well, I have been working on some ideas.

977
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:02,734
Also, we do have a demigod.

978
01:08:03,317 --> 01:08:04,774
Sure, he's a little scruffy,

979
01:08:04,775 --> 01:08:06,399
but he turns out better than nothing.

980
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,566
I think you'll agree.

981
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:11,400
Okay. We sail to the heart of Nalo's storm

982
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:16,650
Once I raise the island,
you all have to get to it.

983
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,320
It will be harder than
anything we faced before.

984
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:21,400
So if anyone wants to...

985
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:30,442
I, uh, spent my whole life
learning our people's stories.

986
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:36,192
Because of you, I get to live one.

987
01:08:38,025 --> 01:08:39,025
Alright, then.

988
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:41,559
Let's break a curse.

989
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:49,317
Yeah, been a while since I
pulled an island from the sea.

990
01:08:51,317 --> 01:08:52,717
I know I have to bend at the knees.

991
01:08:53,317 --> 01:08:54,858
I've got great posture.

992
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:59,275
You know what? You, armpit.

993
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:04,484
He's growing on me - like a wart.

994
01:09:05,317 --> 01:09:05,984
That's beautiful.

995
01:09:05,985 --> 01:09:07,484
Okay, we do this,

996
01:09:08,317 --> 01:09:10,067
we make it home.

997
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,983
Curly.

998
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,316
It's a storm.

999
01:09:20,317 --> 01:09:21,692
Just a really big one.

1000
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:41,650
Well, now I kind of miss the lava monster.

1001
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:48,984
Ah, that's a big wave.

1002
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:53,899
We can go around it.

1003
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,399
Everyone get to your positions.

1004
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,150
Be ready to switch it up.

1005
01:09:58,317 --> 01:10:00,025
You, smart stuff.

1006
01:10:00,317 --> 01:10:01,942
You might want to check the sundial.

1007
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:03,442
Why? What time is it?

1008
01:10:03,817 --> 01:10:06,017
- It's Maui time!
- Whoo!

1009
01:10:06,317 --> 01:10:10,734
Let's lift an island and show
this windbag who's boss.

1010
01:10:11,317 --> 01:10:12,941
Bring the thunder!

1011
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:19,917
I mean it's kind of fun, right?

1012
01:10:20,017 --> 01:10:22,017
Yoohoo!

1013
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,725
Hey, whoa!

1014
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:35,649
Switch it up. We're going over.

1015
01:10:35,743 --> 01:10:37,008
Moana, I'm on it.

1016
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:39,109
Help me.

1017
01:10:58,984 --> 01:11:02,816
Hold on.

1018
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:03,817
Yeah.

1019
01:11:06,317 --> 01:11:09,524
Nailed it. Hahaha.

1020
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:14,125
Aw, come on!

1021
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:17,716
This is coming hot.

1022
01:11:17,817 --> 01:11:20,017
We gotta turn! Guys?

1023
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,584
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1024
01:11:36,008 --> 01:11:38,908
Maui.

1025
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:41,234
It's okay. I got half of 'em. Scoreboard?

1026
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:50,274
Well, Nalo's a cheater

1027
01:11:50,675 --> 01:11:54,342
and a coward for avoiding...

1028
01:11:54,817 --> 01:11:55,609
Hmhm, You know.

1029
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:58,566
He doesn't care about you.

1030
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:00,234
Oh, he cares about me.

1031
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,441
I'm saying -

1032
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,734
it's humans he wants to stop - Us.

1033
01:12:05,317 --> 01:12:07,025
Why are you smiling?

1034
01:12:07,817 --> 01:12:08,900
Because we can use it.

1035
01:12:09,317 --> 01:12:10,837
Distract Nalo, let him come after us.

1036
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:14,399
While Maui reaches the
center and lifts the island.

1037
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,733
We switch it up.

1038
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:19,025
Okay. Curly, you couldn't
outmaneuver the storm before.

1039
01:12:19,317 --> 01:12:20,557
How are you going to do it now?

1040
01:12:20,817 --> 01:12:22,484
I think I have figured it out.

1041
01:12:23,317 --> 01:12:25,692
I will need to chop the mast.

1042
01:12:28,317 --> 01:12:29,584
If you keep coming back to help us,

1043
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:31,893
we'll never break Nalo's curse.

1044
01:12:33,317 --> 01:12:35,692
We can draw the storm, Maui.

1045
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:37,317
It's the only way.

1046
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:47,983
Go as fast as you can.

1047
01:12:48,984 --> 01:12:52,599
Uh, look, I could pull
up a million islands.

1048
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,350
But if you're not there
to land on 'em, then...

1049
01:12:59,317 --> 01:13:00,442
See you out there, Maui.

1050
01:13:02,317 --> 01:13:03,650
See you out there, Moana.

1051
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:08,025
Bacon, eggs?

1052
01:13:10,317 --> 01:13:11,317
Yeah...

1053
01:13:13,317 --> 01:13:14,317
Giant Hawk!

1054
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,234
So serious.

1055
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:19,984
See you on the island.

1056
01:13:28,484 --> 01:13:30,484
- Loto...
- Move!

1057
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:38,275
The spinning thing is coming.

1058
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,900
It's a rough way to prototype this.

1059
01:13:44,317 --> 01:13:47,233
Rutabega!

1060
01:13:56,234 --> 01:13:58,233
Loto, this is the best thing yet!

1061
01:13:58,234 --> 01:13:59,954
Well, I couldn't have done it without Maui.

1062
01:14:34,484 --> 01:14:36,484
Away!

1063
01:14:54,984 --> 01:14:56,484
He found Motufetu.

1064
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:03,383
Oh, The island. We still
have to reach the island.

1065
01:15:03,384 --> 01:15:06,384
We still have to reach the island!

1066
01:15:11,617 --> 01:15:13,542
A little busy!

1067
01:15:18,192 --> 01:15:19,983
Here comes another wave.

1068
01:15:19,984 --> 01:15:20,984
We can see.

1069
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,067
