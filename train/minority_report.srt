1
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,386
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,514
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,496
Murder.

4
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,489
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,408
Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,050
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.

7
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,429
One male, one female.
Killer's male， white， 40s.

8
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:05,434
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.

9
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,188
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

10
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,107
This will be case number 1108.

11
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,280
Morning, detectives.

12
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,659
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

13
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,745
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

14
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:29,499
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

15
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,709
Good morning.

16
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,504
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?

17
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,632
<i>Affirmative. I will validate.</i>

18
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,258
<i>Go get them.</i>

19
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,303
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.

20
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,849
That is 24 minutes， 13 seconds
from now. This is a Red Ball.

21
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,961
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

22
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,507
All right, Howard Marks,
where are you?

23
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,011
Howard? Howard, breakfast.

24
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,946
Four score and seven years ago...

25
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,408
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

26
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,619
A man standing in the park
across the street.

27
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,080
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?

28
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,208
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?

29
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,211
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.

30
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,338
<i>- You know how blind I am...</i>

31
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,565
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.

32
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,570
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.

33
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,949
<i>I was thinking I'd stay home today.</i>

34
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,077
<i>- What about your meeting?</i>
<i>- I've been working too much.</i>

35
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,164
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

36
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,669
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.

37
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,485
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

38
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,825
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.

39
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,245
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.

40
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,291
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky,
stay home today.

41
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,587
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?

42
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,924
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

43
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,593
I've been working too much anyway.

44
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,764
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

45
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,308
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...

46
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,478
- I would love to.
- "The brave men， living and dead...

47
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,439
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

48
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:44,027
- Have consecrated, far above our
poor power to add or detract."

49
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,988
I guess that's why you look so nice.

50
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,828
Chief! We got a problem
with our location.

51
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,000
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!

52
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,169
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

53
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,338
Investigator from the Fed's here.

54
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,966
I don't need some twink
from the Fed poking around.

55
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,676
I wrote it on your calendar.

56
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,262
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

57
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,347
- Check all relations.
- Checking.

58
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,852
Just get him some coffee,
tell him how I save your ass every day.

59
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,520
I got coffee, thanks.

60
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,356
Danny Witwer,
the twink from the Fed.

61
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,358
Oops. Gum?

62
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,027
I'll give you the full tour
some other time.

63
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:30,157
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody
knows where. Still searching for family.

64
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,033
Time horizon, 12 minutes.

65
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,830
He's scrubbing the image, looking for
clues as to where the murder will happen.

66
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:42,169
Original running bond brick pattern，
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.

67
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:48,133
And that this nation， under God,
shall not perish from the earth.

68
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,011
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

69
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,640
Beyond that, all we have to run on
are the images that they produce.

70
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,737
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?

71
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,573
- No maglev system.
- Come on.

72
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,742
Georgetown.

73
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,078
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

74
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,708
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no
premeditation, so they show up late.

75
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,421
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.

76
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,423
People have gotten the message.

77
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:33,011
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

78
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,599
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.

79
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,606
Look at this kid.

80
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,817
In this one,
he's on the left side of the man.

81
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,569
Yes. So?

82
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,571
This one he's on the right.

83
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,590
Merry-go-round.

84
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,509
It's a park.

85
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,558
There's only 16 of these old
merry-go-rounds left in the city.

86
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,435
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.

87
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,230
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?

88
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,983
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.

89
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,914
- Clear.
- Clear.

90
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,812
Time horizon, six minutes.

91
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,933
Let's go to bed.

92
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,186
Let's do it in here.

93
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,815
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

94
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,238
Shit.

95
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,282
Which one is it?

96
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,667
- Not the bed.
- Come on.

97
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,128
I don't want to be on the bed.

98
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,802
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

99
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,555
<i>- Jad?</i>
- Go ahead.

100
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,516
<i>- Did he close the front door?</i>
- What?

101
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,144
Did Marks close the front door?

102
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,653
Front door...

103
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,784
I didn't wanna be on the bed.

104
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,668
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.

105
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,678
I forgot my glasses.

106
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,971
Howard.

107
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,027
You know how blind I am without them.

108
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,322
Howard, don't cry.

109
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,782
Marks!

110
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,719
Look at me. Look at me.

111
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,810
Positive for Howard Marks.

112
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,230
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...

113
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,609
...you're under arrest for the future
murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...

114
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,279
...that was to take place today
at 0800 hours and four minutes.

115
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,367
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.

116
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,871
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!

117
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,626
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!

118
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,546
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.

119
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,048
Sit here a minute and listen to me.

120
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,093
Your husband is being arrested
by Precrime.

121
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,096
Oh, God, Howard， no.

122
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,767
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.

123
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,525
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

124
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,196
I thought they stopped the murder.

125
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,784
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will.

126
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,246
The really bad ones
the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.

127
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,665
Wally, erase the incoming.

128
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,474
<i>Imagine a world without murder.</i>

129
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,436
<i>- I lost my best friend.</i>
<i>- I lost my aunt.</i>

130
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,730
<i>- I lost my dad.</i>
<i>- I lost my wife.</i>

131
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:03,610
<i>Just six years ago, the homicide rate</i>
<i>had reached epidemic proportions.</i>

132
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,905
<i>It seemed that only a miracle</i>
<i>could stop the bloodshed.</i>

133
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,326
<i>But instead of one miracle, we</i>
<i>were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.</i>

134
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,329
<i>Within just one month</i>
<i>under the Precrime program...</i>

135
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,124
<i>... the murder rate in the District</i>
<i>of Columbia was reduced 90%.</i>

136
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,460
<i>- They were waiting for me.</i>
<i>- He was gonna rape me.</i>

137
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,503
<i>- I was going to be stabbed.</i>
<i>- Right here.</i>

138
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:27,216
<i>Within a year, Precrime effectively</i>
<i>stopped murder in our nation's capital.</i>

139
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,636
<i>In the six years of our experiment...</i>

140
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,306
<i>... there hasn't been a single murder.</i>

141
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,683
<i>And now Precrime can work for you.</i>

142
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,811
<i>We want to make certain</i>
<i>that every American...</i>

143
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,106
<i>... can bank on the infallibility</i>
<i>of the system.</i>

144
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,820
<i>And to ensure that what keeps us safe</i>
<i>will also keep us free.</i>

145
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,199
<i>- Precrime. It works.</i>
<i>- It works.</i>

146
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,619
<i>- It works.</i>
<i>- It works.</i>

147
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,580
<i>Precrime. It works.</i>

148
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:02,794
<i>On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes"</i>
<i>on the National Precrime Initiative.</i>

149
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,217
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

150
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,350
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.

151
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,689
You want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity?

152
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,565
Give me the new stuff.

153
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,405
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes， indeed.

154
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,323
Come on. Come on.

155
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,910
Don't bust my balls. You've only given
me four, and some of these are duds.

156
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,912
Sweet dreams， chief.

157
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,418
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

158
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,004
I could use a little juice on my side.

159
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,464
What do you think you know?

160
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,384
It's like my daddy used to say:

161
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,096
"In the land of the blind...

162
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,560
...the one-eyed man is king."

163
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,082
I'm home.

164
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,675
Overhead.

165
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,483
Wall screen.

166
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,534
<i>- Sean.</i>
<i>- Hi, Daddy.</i>

167
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,370
<i>Can you teach me how to run faster?</i>

168
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,583
<i>Because all the kids in my class</i>
<i>run faster than me.</i>

169
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,127
<i>That's good.</i>

170
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,587
Keep your knees up.

171
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,383
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.

172
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,220
- See, you're a natural runner.
<i>- Gotta keep running.</i>

173
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,306
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

174
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,642
Gotta keep running.

175
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,939
<i>- Will I be as fast as you someday?</i>
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

176
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,860
<i>- You're gonna beat everybody.</i>
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.

177
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,280
<i>- I gotta go. Bye.</i>
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

178
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,283
- You gotta give me a kiss.
<i>- Not on the lips.</i>

179
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,078
<i>Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.</i>

180
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,746
<i>Yeah, all right. All right.</i>

181
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,707
I love you.

182
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,627
<i>- I love you, Sean.</i>
<i>- I love you, Daddy.</i>

183
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,040
<i>Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.</i>

184
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,001
<i>Remember?</i>

185
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,463
<i>We had 20 dollars and...</i>

186
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,384
<i>Waiting in that van so the sun</i>
<i>would shine on our vacation.</i>

187
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,807
<i>John. John. John,</i>
<i>put the camera down.</i>

188
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:32,146
<i>Look, I'm all ready for bed.</i>
<i>What is this? No. Put it away.</i>

189
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,774
<i>It's time to put the camera</i>
<i>to sleep...</i>

190
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,277
<i>... and time to come</i>
<i>and take care of your wife.</i>

191
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:46,369
<i>Why don't you put the camera down</i>
<i>and come and watch the rain with me?</i>

192
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,623
<i>No? I promise I'll make it</i>
<i>a memorable moment.</i>

193
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,172
<i>Put the camera down</i>
<i>or you're not getting anything tonight.</i>

194
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,175
A gentleman at Justice
wants to take this away from us.

195
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,137
In a week, people will vote
on whether or not...

196
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,640
...what we've been doing has been
a noble-minded enterprise...

197
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,185
...or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

198
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,729
John...

199
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,692
...watch this Danny Witwer,
the observer from Justice.

200
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,778
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.

201
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,239
Answer his questions，
but watch him.

202
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,242
If there's any problem,
make sure we know about it.

203
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,747
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer,
their name is embedded in the wood.

204
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:17,585
Since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique， they're impossible to forge.

205
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,505
You understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

206
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,425
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...

207
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,261
...but we arrest individuals
who've broken no law.

208
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,097
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.

209
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,017
The Pre-Cogs see the future，
and they're never wrong.

210
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,977
But it's not the future if you stop it.

211
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,606
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.

212
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,735
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

213
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,157
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.

214
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,575
You're certain?

215
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,203
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

216
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,124
Preventing it doesn't change
the fact that it was going to happen.

217
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,710
You ever get any false positives?

218
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,924
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?

219
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,969
They don't see what you intend to do,
only what you will do.

220
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,098
Why can't they see
rapes， assaults, suicides?

221
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,308
Because of the nature of murder.

222
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,853
Nothing's more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us...

223
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:22,066
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.

224
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,987
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs,
designed the system and the interface.

225
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,074
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

226
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,661
- To Hineman?
- To them.

227
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:38,791
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?

228
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,378
We keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

229
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,799
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

230
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,845
- Lf it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.

231
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,847
You don't have any.

232
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,350
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

233
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,948
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

234
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,956
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel is conducted...

235
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:23,752
...under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general.

236
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,213
I'm here as his representative...

237
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,468
...which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

238
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,184
Seems you've been left
out of the loop.

239
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,821
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

240
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,831
- Hold it right there. Hold on.
<i>- Not cleared for access.</i>

241
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,710
<i>Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.</i>

242
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,969
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

243
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,473
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

244
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,267
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.

245
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,729
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.

246
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,482
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.

247
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,610
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

248
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,656
The photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor.

249
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:38,118
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.

250
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:43,290
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.

251
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,335
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear...

252
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,630
...and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

253
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,300
In other words, we see what they see.

254
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,264
They don't feel pain. We keep
their heads stocked with dopamine.

255
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,934
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

256
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,104
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

257
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,942
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.

258
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,779
No. They're much more than that.

259
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,159
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

260
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,999
In a way， they give us hope，
hope of the existence of the divine.

261
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,003
It's interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.

262
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,422
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.

263
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,675
- Yet you call this room the "temple."
- A nickname.

264
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,011
The oracle isn't where
the power is， anyway.

265
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,849
The power is with the priests,
even if they had to invent the oracle.

266
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,353
You guys are nodding like you know
what he's talking about.

267
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,983
Well, come on, chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all...

268
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,235
...we're more like clergy than cops.

269
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,029
- Jad.
- Yeah?

270
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,782
Go to work. All of you.

271
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,043
Sorry. Old habit.

272
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,880
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

273
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,300
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?

274
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:21,180
I don't know. He was shot and killed
when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

275
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,266
I know what it's like
to lose someone close.

276
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,685
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

277
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:31,106
I don't have any children， so I can
only imagine what that was like.

278
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,943
To lose your son
in such a public place like that...

279
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,322
Now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

280
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,242
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

281
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,287
There hasn't been a murder
in six years. This system is...

282
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:50,084
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

283
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,586
It always is.

284
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,381
John.

285
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,091
Wally.

286
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,976
Can you see?

287
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,636
What happened? Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

288
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,764
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.

289
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,768
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.

290
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,980
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.

291
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,400
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

292
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,402
What'd she say?

293
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,071
"Can you see?"

294
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,468
You the sentry?

295
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,971
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

296
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,224
You're Chief Anderton.

297
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,644
The music relaxes the prisoners.

298
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,314
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?

299
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,692
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.

300
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,446
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.

301
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,533
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.

302
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,161
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

303
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,791
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

304
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,000
Stop.

305
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,089
Roll back.

306
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,883
There.

307
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:50,889
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

308
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,352
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.

309
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,564
Combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

310
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,109
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...

311
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,946
...we go for a ride.

312
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,553
My God.

313
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,014
I'd forgotten there were so many.

314
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:37,102
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

315
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,480
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.

316
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,568
But on the inside: Busy， busy, busy.

317
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:49,281
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.

318
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,993
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

319
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,997
The killer's a John Doe,
never identified.

320
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,600
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

321
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:21,521
Those are not his eyes. He had them
swapped out to fool the scanners.

322
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,692
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

323
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,696
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

324
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,490
That's right.

325
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,874
We don't seem to have her data.

326
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,335
Try again.

327
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,382
This is odd. See?

328
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:53,428
We have the two previsions. We got
what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

329
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,640
But Agatha's isn't here.

330
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,519
Probably just a glitch.

331
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:05,023
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

332
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,403
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here.

333
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,531
Address history
includes the Beaton Clinic.

334
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,909
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?

335
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,414
I guess glitches come in twos.

336
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:26,837
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

337
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,051
No.

338
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,472
Can't let you take that out of here,
chief.

339
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,060
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?

340
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:53,780
Careful, chief. You dig up the past,
all you get is dirty.

341
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,039
The third prevision was what,
kind of fuzzy or something?

342
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:06,460
No， the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

343
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:11,798
That's not all. There are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions.

344
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,218
You'd think we'd have found
the cure for the common cold.

345
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,721
- It's stress.
- What's this?

346
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,890
Herbal tea with honey.

347
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,602
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.

348
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,646
Just drink it，
before I pour it in your lap.

349
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,691
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.

350
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,653
Witwer's scheduled for a tour
of Containment tomorrow.

351
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,822
Yeah, give him a tour.

352
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,701
- Lara called me.
- What?

353
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,663
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

354
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,749
I'm fine.

355
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,836
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the Sprawl.

356
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,174
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.

357
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,928
What if Danny Witwer
insisted on a full chem run?

358
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,805
I'm fine.

359
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:05,769
The minute Precrime goes national,
they are going to take it away.

360
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,313
- We won't let them.
- No?

361
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,818
How is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them?

362
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,821
My father once said to me...

363
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,200
..."You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you."

364
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,285
There's a reason you are here.

365
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:28,250
Had Precrime been in place earlier，
your loss would have been prevented.

366
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,001
Remember, the eyes...

367
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,757
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

368
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,302
I'm not the generation
anyone listens to...

369
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,682
...but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in Precrime.

370
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,728
They know that it's a belief born of
pain, not politics. I understood that.

371
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,482
I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

372
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:58,071
But now,
your pain is hurting both of us.

373
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,744
They're not going to take it
away from us.

374
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,414
I won't let them.

375
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,487
Bingo.

376
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,502
<i>- Hi, Daddy.</i>
<i>- Hey, buddy.</i>

377
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,630
<i>- I made up a club.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

378
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,467
<i>- We're called the Crescos.</i>
<i>- The Crescos.</i>

379
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,178
<i>- We made up a soccer team.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

380
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,097
<i>- We practice at school.</i>
<i>- With Connor?</i>

381
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,434
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.

382
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,836
- Wait!
- No!

383
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,217
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?

384
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:48,181
We're in motion on something. We got a
white， male victim， about 5'10"， 170.

385
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,934
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

386
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,936
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.

387
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,354
It's premeditated.

388
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:58,191
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.

389
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,901
The victim's name is Leo Crow.

390
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,656
This is case number 1109. Time of
occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.

391
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:09,327
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109，
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

392
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,831
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

393
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,502
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

394
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,962
Good morning.

395
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,840
Are you ready
to preview and validate 1109?

396
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,968
<i>- Ready when you are, John.</i>
<i>- Standing by.</i>

397
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,517
I love this part.

398
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:38,565
I've got no address. No tax returns
for the last five years.

399
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,318
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.

400
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,905
We'll send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

401
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,745
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete， glass， egg crates.

402
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,998
Ouch. About a thousand of those
in the District.

403
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,293
Fractured images coming in.

404
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,879
Numbers nine...

405
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,133
Nine， six.

406
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,725
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

407
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,852
She's laughing.

408
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,566
Okay, now I'm inside a room.

409
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,236
Windowpanes， aluminum extrusion.

410
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,948
Two figures resolving in the room.

411
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,118
<i>- Wait!</i>
- No...

412
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,874
Looks like we got a third party.

413
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,419
Wearing sunglasses，
just out the window.

414
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,089
You're not gonna kill me.

415
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,301
Goodbye， Crow.

416
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,101
<i>You're not gonna kill me.</i>

417
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,478
<i>- Goodbye, Crow.</i>
<i>- Wait!</i>

418
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,484
Wait. Wait.

419
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,903
You say something, chief?

420
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,321
No.

421
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,493
I'll get this one.

422
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,995
We got time on this one, Jad.

423
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,124
Mind getting me a piece
of cake they're eating?

424
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,167
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.

425
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,170
I think I'll get one for myself too.

426
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,839
Take your time.

427
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,192
<i>Chief Anderton,</i>
<i>what is this that I'm seeing?</i>

428
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,403
<i>I'm confused about...</i>

429
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,353
<i>- Anderton, wait!</i>
<i>- Goodbye, Crow.</i>

430
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:27,692
<i>Anderton, wait!</i>

431
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,660
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.

432
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,916
Give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

433
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,725
Hold that， please.

434
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,269
Thanks.

435
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:10,235
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

436
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,363
I'll write the paranoia off to the
whiff you've been doping on.

437
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,822
Easy.

438
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,283
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.

439
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,995
What are you gonna do?

440
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,123
Possession will cost you six months
and your badge.

441
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,793
I guess we won't be working together
after all.

442
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:30,630
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

443
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,153
<i>Lamar. Lamar.</i>

444
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,117
<i>- Lamar?</i>
- John， what is happening?

445
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,327
It's Witwer. He set me up!

446
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,829
Stop, just wait.

447
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,957
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?

448
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,792
- Somebody.
- Who?

449
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,003
- Somebody... Leo Crow.
<i>- Who is he?</i>

450
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,964
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.

451
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,175
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

452
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,637
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?

453
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,472
- Why would anyone want to?
<i>- Can you?</i>

454
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,017
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?

455
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,269
- Now listen, come in.
- What?

456
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,896
I'll protect you until we
get to the bottom of this.

457
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,150
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

458
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,820
Ask Jad for any off-hour
eye-dents into the analytical room.

459
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,364
Who's Leo Crow?

460
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,367
<i>Security lockdown enabled.</i>
<i>Revised destination: Office.</i>

461
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,245
Lamar， they found me.

462
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,878
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

463
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,005
<i>- No, no, no.</i>
- No?

464
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,717
<i>I'll meet you anywhere you say.</i>
<i>You can come to my house, John.</i>

465
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,511
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

466
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,846
You can't run.

467
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,057
Everybody runs.

468
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,022
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.

469
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,289
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

470
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,753
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.

471
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,631
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.

472
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,049
What?

473
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,679
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.

474
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,266
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes， sir.

475
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,896
He came to see you the other day
right before he was tagged.

476
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,691
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

477
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,736
John doesn't think they have a deep
enough pitching roster.

478
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,823
Why are you protecting him? You knew
he was doping, yet you did nothing.

479
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,368
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.

480
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,621
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.

481
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:55,334
It's my business. Investigation of a
supervising officer for a capital crime...

482
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,630
...falls under federal jurisdiction
so as to rule out any conspiracy.

483
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,258
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

484
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,095
Call the attorney general. I'm sure
he'd clarify the issue for you.

485
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,640
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

486
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,895
I'm going to enjoy working here.

487
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,025
<i>A road diverges in the desert.</i>

488
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,943
<i>Lexus.</i>

489
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,031
<i>The road you're on, John Anderton,</i>
<i>is the one less-traveled.</i>

490
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,367
<i>- Make sure you...</i>
<i>- Diamonds...</i>

491
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,663
<i>Good evening, John Anderton.</i>

492
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:39,796
<i>John Anderton! You could use</i>
<i>a Guinness right about now.</i>

493
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,051
<i>- John Anderton...</i>
<i>- Escape from it all.</i>

494
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,931
<i>Get away, John Anderton.</i>
<i>Forget your troubles.</i>

495
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:11,369
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.

496
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,371
Send units to each location.

497
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,373
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.

498
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,832
Fire them up!

499
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,983
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

500
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,319
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

501
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,946
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.

502
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,073
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

503
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,659
Hey, don't do this.

504
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,661
John?

505
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,330
Don't run.

506
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,874
You don't have to chase me.

507
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,126
You don't have to run.

508
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,337
Everybody runs, Fletch.

509
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,547
You know we'll catch you.

510
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,258
Everybody runs.

511
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:55,348
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

512
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,642
Get your sick-sticks ready.

513
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,770
Everybody runs, Fletch.

514
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,898
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

515
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,820
No sudden moves, chief.

516
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,032
John, it's okay.

517
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,701
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.

518
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,564
Got a grip?

519
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,483
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.

520
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,680
Anderton!

521
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,547
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

522
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,800
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!

523
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,306
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!

524
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,184
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

525
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,105
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!

526
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,404
Get out of my house! Go!

527
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:40,262
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...

528
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,847
Go to sleep.

529
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,245
You two stay with me!

530
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,517
Dr. Hineman.

531
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,354
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.

532
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,654
That would be from the doll's eye,
the vine...

533
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,157
...the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

534
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:56,161
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.

535
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:00,124
Once the poison gets into your
bloodstream, you'll start to see...

536
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:04,503
...the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

537
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,173
This just isn't your week, is it?

538
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,176
Chief Anderton.

539
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,180
I'm not a killer.

540
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,688
You better drink this.

541
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,942
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

542
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,445
All of it.

543
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,615
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

544
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,579
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

545
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,461
You could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision.

546
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,629
How would I know that?

547
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,507
Because you invented Precrime.

548
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,136
What's so funny?

549
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:59,725
If the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire...

550
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,769
...can be called an invention，
then I invented Precrime.

551
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,980
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.

552
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,358
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

553
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,320
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

554
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,740
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.

555
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:20,120
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.

556
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,124
I was doing genetic research,
treating children of drug addicts.

557
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,961
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

558
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:34,343
It was impure, not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated.

559
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:41,016
All of these kids were born with severe
brain damage. Most died before age 12.

560
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,936
Those few who survived,
they had a gift.

561
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,439
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

562
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,400
They would wake up in the night,
curled in the corner...

563
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,528
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

564
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:57,032
Because when these children
closed their eyes at night...

565
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,662
...they dreamt only of murder
over and over, one after the other.

566
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:05,457
It didn't take long for us to realize
that the real nightmare was...

567
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:10,629
...that these dreams were about to come
true, these murders were happening.

568
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,969
You say some of the children died?

569
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,389
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.

570
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:24,851
Or maybe because of what we
did to them. But it doesn't matter.

571
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,854
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

572
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,108
I'm not going to commit murder.

573
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,694
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

574
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:38,156
And yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder.

575
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,159
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?

576
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,329
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.

577
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,332
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.

578
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,837
But occasionally...

579
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,506
...they do disagree.

580
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,175
What?

581
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:02,055
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs
will see an event in the same way...

582
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:06,184
...but once in a while, one of them will
see things differently than the others.

583
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:10,397
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

584
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,359
Because these Minority Reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

585
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,694
Why?

586
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:20,824
For Precrime to function, there can't
be any suggestion of fallibility.

587
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,202
Who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

588
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:27,289
It may be reasonable,
but it's still doubt.

589
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,543
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

590
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,464
I'm saying that every so often，
those accused of a Precrime...

591
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,216
...just might have
an alternate future.

592
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:42,304
Does Burgess know about this,
about this Minority Report?

593
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:46,058
I used to joke with Lamar that
we were the parents of Precrime.

594
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:51,146
Parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are.

595
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:56,485
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?

596
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,320
Yes, of course, he knew.

597
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:03,742
But at the time， we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable.

598
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,869
Insignificant to you, maybe.

599
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:09,831
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?

600
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,710
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.

601
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,382
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

602
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,175
You wanna bring it down.

603
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:24,262
You will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim.

604
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:29,518
That'll be the most spectacular public
display of how Precrime didn't work.

605
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,646
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

606
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:36,274
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.

607
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,695
Certainly not the attorney general,
who wants it all for himself.

608
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,614
And not the young federal agent,
who wants your job.

609
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:47,035
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

610
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,622
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.

611
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,418
You said the Minority Report
is destroyed.

612
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,296
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

613
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:03,677
I designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place， but not declared.

614
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,138
What safe place is that?

615
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,599
The safest place there is.

616
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,769
Where is it?

617
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,859
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.

618
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:27,993
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

619
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,246
That's all, huh?

620
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,502
Just walk into Precrime,
get into the temple...

621
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:42,340
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs
and download this Minority Report.

622
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,051
- Lf you have one.
- And then walk out.

623
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:49,723
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.

624
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,684
You're insane.

625
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,395
Or you think I am.

626
01:02:55,563 --> 01:03:00,817
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

627
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:05,781
Sometimes in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

628
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,326
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...

629
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,204
...l'm sure that you know
all sorts of people...

630
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,707
...who can help you out
in this regard.

631
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,883
It's funny how all
living organisms are alike.

632
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,720
When the chips are down，
when the pressure is on...

633
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,890
...every creature
on the face of the earth...

634
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,519
...is interested in one thing
and one thing only:

635
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,730
Lts own survival.

636
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,484
Find the Minority Report.

637
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:50,367
How do I even know which one has it?

638
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,829
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

639
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,332
Which one is that?

640
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,170
The female.

641
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,969
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...

642
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:13,348
...John is here， and this
unidentified male, at the window.

643
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:17,352
The adjacent building suggests
public housing, which means...

644
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,355
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.

645
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,441
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

646
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,819
This is Chief Anderton's space.

647
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,946
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.

648
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,825
I doubt that. I'm betting
he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

649
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:35,829
He's smart enough to go
where billboards can't ID him.

650
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,415
There's fewer consumers,
which means fewer scanners.

651
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,794
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

652
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,881
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

653
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,134
We do fly-overs in ships,
with two spyder teams on the ground.

654
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:53,638
Thermal scan the entire area. Read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

655
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,822
Where is she?

656
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:35,263
<i>Started blowing buttons for no reason</i>
<i>whatsoever, and I knew that.</i>

657
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,977
This damn cold.

658
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:46,358
Don't worry. I could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there...

659
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:51,196
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not
with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

660
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,864
That's comforting.

661
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,493
You do understand I can't just
give you new irises?

662
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,078
Please, don't touch.

663
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:02,207
Because the scanners would read the
new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

664
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,001
...and large men with guns will appear.

665
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,548
What was that?

666
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:15,303
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?

667
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,599
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

668
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,393
Please, relax.

669
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:31,236
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll
have to remove your eyes completely.

670
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,570
I know.

671
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:37,742
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

672
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,579
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.

673
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:44,082
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.

674
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,168
Whatever you say. It's your money.

675
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:59,097
Let me introduce my gorgeous
assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

676
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:24,289
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

677
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,835
Okay.

678
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:36,009
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.

679
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,678
Tell you what, since we go way back...

680
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:43,141
...why don't I give you my old pal
discount? What do you say?

681
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,560
You don't remember me, do you?

682
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:49,230
- We know each other?
- Yes， we do.

683
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,483
From where? D. C?

684
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:56,196
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.

685
01:07:56,363 --> 01:08:00,408
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

686
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:05,830
You remember? Specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

687
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,667
- I put you away.
- Yeah， you did.

688
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,713
You made those tapes.

689
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,508
They were performance pieces.

690
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:21,930
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.

691
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:27,519
Some not as quickly as others, but
let's change the subject, shall we?

692
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:34,901
The future's so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

693
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,699
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

694
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:46,579
She only has eyes for you.

695
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:51,417
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?

696
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:56,297
Let's say that I spent an awful lot
of time in the prison library.

697
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:01,719
That was a great way to avoid the more
unpleasant aspects of prison life.

698
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:05,223
Confinement was
a real education, a real...

699
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,893
...eye-opener.

700
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,484
For true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like...

701
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:20,071
...well, let's say, taking a shower
while this large fellow...

702
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,741
...with an attitude you can't
knock down with a hammer...

703
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,077
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy."

704
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,914
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...

705
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:34,335
...and giving me the opportunity to
get to know myself so much better.

706
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,963
And now to return the favor.

707
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,436
- This your work?
- Yes.

708
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,688
I like it.

709
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,941
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.

710
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,652
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.

711
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,238
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.

712
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,199
He's not here now, is he?

713
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,244
I had to ask.

714
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,625
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.

715
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:16,753
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

716
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,505
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?

717
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,592
No， but I don't talk
to John much anymore.

718
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,304
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.

719
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,474
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.

720
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:34,229
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.

721
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:39,859
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.

722
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:45,657
But John was with him
at the public pool.

723
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:48,576
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

724
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,121
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?

725
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:56,334
The FBI found something
that belonged to my son, a sandal.

726
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,127
John was upset. He...

727
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,297
He took out his gun
and watched home movies.

728
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:05,718
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

729
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:09,555
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

730
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:15,061
Lamar thinks you left John because he
lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

731
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:20,275
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

732
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:25,613
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

733
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,408
That's why I left him.

734
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,661
And now you can leave.

735
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,749
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

736
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:45,883
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

737
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:51,014
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.

738
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,975
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

739
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,144
How do I find the bathroom?

740
01:11:56,645 --> 01:12:00,231
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

741
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,403
The kitchen is your left.

742
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,408
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

743
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:15,496
Seeing as we're being pals, I'II give
you a bonus that may come in handy.

744
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:20,084
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

745
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,755
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

746
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,341
People won't even recognize you.

747
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:30,887
In 30 minutes， it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

748
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:35,058
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag,
together with your...

749
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,101
...leftovers.

750
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:44,442
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings,
you can remove the bandages and leave.

751
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,529
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.

752
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,615
Don't scratch.

753
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:56,329
A little something from
a mutual friend of ours.

754
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:35,660
<i>Don't take the bandages off</i>
<i>for 12 hours.</i>

755
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:41,332
<i>If you take them off before then,</i>
<i>you'll go blind. Understand?</i>

756
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:06,858
- 25.16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?

757
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:10,528
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.

758
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,698
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.

759
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,868
There's no way
I can beat 25.16 seconds.

760
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,871
How long can a whale hold its breath?

761
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,206
For about 20 minutes.

762
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:25,710
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

763
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,839
We gotta beat the whale.

764
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,757
Here you go.

765
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,803
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure
you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

766
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,015
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.

767
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,058
- Ready?
- Give me the count.

768
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,436
Three, two, one, go!

769
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:06,667
Sean?

770
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,963
Sean.

771
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,263
Have you seen...?

772
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:25,269
I'm looking for my son. Have you
seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

773
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,441
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

774
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,735
Sean?

775
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:38,407
Sean!

776
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:23,429
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan
on all residences on North Powell.

777
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,974
You must really like me， don't you?

778
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:30,061
That's why you asked to partner
with me on this sortie.

779
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:31,687
You're swell company.

780
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:35,107
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the chief, is it?

781
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:37,568
That you think I might, you know,
futz with him?

782
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:41,572
No， I just wanna watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

783
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,782
Evanna, go.

784
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,661
I show 27 warm bodies.

785
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,705
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

786
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:54,794
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

787
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:15,439
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

788
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:20,861
Under authority of P.C. Section 6409， we
are deploying spyders into your complex.

789
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:24,448
Mom, I'm scared.

790
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,159
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

791
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,288
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

792
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,290
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.

793
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,584
Stay still. Stay still.

794
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,276
Come on!

795
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,987
You stepped out on me
for the last time.

796
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,780
I told you where I was.

797
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:07,825
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.

798
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,660
You're lucky we...

799
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,958
Leave me alone!

800
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,786
We lost one.

801
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:38,082
Roger that. Maybe it was
a cat jumping through a window.

802
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,209
It's an awful big cat.

803
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,752
Fletcher.

804
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,713
I'll go check it out.

805
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,505
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.

806
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,924
Keep your kids away from me.

807
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:48,652
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

808
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,447
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

809
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,158
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

810
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,254
Be quiet and close the door.

811
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,597
We got an ID. It's not him.

812
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:21,435
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.

813
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:37,576
Fletcher, take a look.

814
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:42,456
There's four people in this room,
not three.

815
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,126
Four? There's Anderton, Crow
and the man in sunglasses.

816
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:49,588
The man in the sunglasses
is outside the window.

817
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:56,720
There's also someone here
in the mirror.

818
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,556
Definitely female.

819
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,228
The Precrime program began in 2046
with a federal grant.

820
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:09,650
And now, nine years later,
D.C. Is the safest city in America.

821
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,236
Why? Because Precrime works.

822
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:15,614
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives.

823
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:20,619
What happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims.

824
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,413
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?

825
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:27,084
They have such a powerful gift,
they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

826
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,253
...so as not to be distracted.

827
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,924
This display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

828
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:38,554
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.

829
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,681
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

830
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:44,560
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.

831
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,895
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.

832
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,798
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

833
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,301
He's just not very intelligent.

834
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:23,307
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.

835
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,776
Shit!

836
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,421
<i>Eye-dent: John Anderton.</i>
<i>Approved for entry.</i>

837
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,429
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.

838
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:07,184
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...

839
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:13,440
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?

840
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:20,739
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?

841
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,991
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.

842
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,868
- Do I know you?
- I like you.

843
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:28,122
So I don't wanna have
to kick you or hit you.

844
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,833
But only if you promise to help me.

845
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:33,877
Hi, John.

846
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,680
Who does that look like to you?

847
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:47,891
I don't know.

848
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:56,066
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.

849
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:02,406
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

850
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,577
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

851
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:11,123
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.

852
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,086
Can you see?

853
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:32,311
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.

854
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:34,438
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!

855
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,524
Nobody fires a weapon inside
the temple. Use bindfoam.

856
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:41,153
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.

857
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:46,950
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.

858
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,053
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?

859
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,473
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing.

860
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:14,853
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?

861
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:21,318
They're a hive mind. It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

862
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,364
They can't see murders anymore?

863
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:29,368
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...

864
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,787
...the one with the most talent.

865
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:35,332
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.

866
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,586
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!

867
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:42,839
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'II stop him.

868
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:47,886
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.

869
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:51,473
Jad, put everything you've got into
finding that room, and we stop a murder.

870
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,851
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...

871
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:57,771
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

872
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:02,901
You cold? Can you understand me?

873
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:07,030
Are you cold? The shivers，
it's the drugs we gave you.

874
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:11,535
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.

875
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,497
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.

876
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,459
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?

877
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:21,545
- Is it now?
- What?

878
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,547
Is it now?

879
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,635
Yes, this is all happening right now.

880
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,555
I'm taking you some place in public...

881
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,558
...which means you need
something else to wear.

882
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:38,770
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

883
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:47,738
<i>Hello, Mr. Yakamoto,</i>
<i>welcome back to the Gap.</i>

884
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:51,241
<i>How'd those assorted tank tops</i>
<i>work out for you?</i>

885
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,785
Mr. Yakamoto?

886
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:03,587
<i>Miss Belfor, did you come back for</i>
<i>another pair of those chammy lace-ups?</i>

887
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:21,772
- Lf it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.

888
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:25,776
It has to do with the information
inside of Agatha.

889
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:31,448
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.

890
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,201
Your average consumer can't buy
any of this stuff.

891
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:38,872
It's been assembled and scrounged
from spare parts made to order.

892
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:43,835
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

893
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:56,348
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

894
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,353
What's your pleasure? We got it
all here: Sports fantasies...

895
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,647
..."Look， Ma, I can fly" fantasies...

896
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:07,984
...which covers everything from bungee
jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.

897
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:10,612
You can experience sex as a woman.

898
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,658
Women come in to get laid
by their favorite soap star.

899
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,661
Or just some good, clean fun.

900
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:23,291
It's a big rush, but you come out
without a heart attack.

901
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:26,294
I wanna kill my boss.

902
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:28,964
Okay.

903
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:33,510
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.

904
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,347
Yeah, being concertmaster
for the Philadelphia Symphony...

905
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,224
...is a popular choice.

906
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:42,185
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.

907
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:45,313
You make this a terrible world
to live in!

908
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:49,651
Detective, nice of you to come here，
seeing how every cop is looking for you.

909
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,446
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?

910
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:55,866
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.

911
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:59,661
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

912
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:04,040
...and you still have the time to
slice off a little... jerky for yourself.

913
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:07,419
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

914
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:09,880
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.

915
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:15,051
You brought a Pre-Cog here.

916
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,984
Jesus Christ.

917
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,404
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

918
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:40,243
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

919
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:46,583
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.

920
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:49,961
No way. I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

921
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:53,590
Those thoughts about my cousin
were just thoughts.

922
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:56,176
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?

923
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,762
So I need you to hack into her.

924
01:32:01,807 --> 01:32:06,853
I do this， I get to keep
whatever images I get from her head.

925
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:10,941
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.

926
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,985
You're gonna help me.

927
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:24,996
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's gonna happen to me.

928
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:27,958
And then we'll go.

929
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,475
- She works.
- Slow it down.

930
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:50,355
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

931
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:59,322
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

932
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,700
Yeah, recording.

933
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,854
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.

934
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:35,692
Goodbye， Crow.

935
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,194
<i>Goodbye, Crow.</i>

936
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:48,455
- What happened?
- I don't know.

937
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:50,290
- What happened?
- I don't...

938
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:53,877
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

939
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:59,257
Where's my Minority Report?

940
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:03,053
Do I even have one?

941
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:11,019
- Do I have one?
- No.

942
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,231
- What?
- No.

943
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,407
What?

944
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:27,744
Agatha? What? What?

945
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:30,789
- Can you see?
- See what?

946
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,765
Anne Lively.

947
01:34:56,607 --> 01:35:01,277
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?

948
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,447
Yeah, but it's pouring
out of her backwards.

949
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,330
I like my life. Everything's good.

950
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:25,176
They're inside.

951
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:27,387
Who?

952
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,306
All your old teammates.

953
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:34,185
Kenny， left chamber.
Alan, straight across.

954
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:35,353
Negative!

955
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,981
- Negative!
- Negative!

956
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:39,649
I don't deserve that.

957
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:42,318
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

958
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:51,327
Can you see the umbrella?

959
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,538
Take it.

960
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:55,415
Take it!

961
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:04,048
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.

962
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:15,268
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

963
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,688
Turn in here.

964
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,863
Let's go.

965
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:34,370
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.

966
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:36,623
Can you see the balloon man?

967
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:40,293
Wait.

968
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:46,883
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?

969
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:54,098
Wait. Wait.

970
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,184
Wait.

971
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,896
- Please, Mommy， can I have one?
- All right.

972
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,358
Wait.

973
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:10,406
Thank you.

974
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,993
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

975
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:18,706
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

976
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:33,012
He knows. Don't go home.

977
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,897
We've got eyes on.

978
01:37:43,065 --> 01:37:45,692
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

979
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,778
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?

980
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:50,947
Drop some money.

981
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:56,119
Can't you put it in my hand?

982
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,913
May the Lord bless you.

983
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:02,709
May God take care of you.

984
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:23,730
Damn!

985
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:56,137
That's the guy.
The man in the window.

986
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:16,324
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

987
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:18,201
I mind.

988
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:19,994
How about now?

989
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:22,163
Help yourself.

990
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:37,178
He's here.

991
01:39:37,763 --> 01:39:39,889
Anderton, leave.

992
01:39:46,772 --> 01:39:49,732
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.

993
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,569
I can't. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

994
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:54,904
Please.

995
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:59,242
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

996
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,619
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

997
01:40:02,496 --> 01:40:05,581
Come on.

998
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:26,579
Wrong room.

999
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,820
Leave.

1000
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:56,836
Oh, God.

1001
01:43:01,633 --> 01:43:02,925
This is Sean.

1002
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:05,261
My son.

1003
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:15,188
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:

1004
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:20,860
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today...

1005
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:25,698
...if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street.

1006
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:32,997
And the second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1007
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,503
You're right.

1008
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:42,632
I'm not being set up.

1009
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:48,262
You have to take me home.

1010
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:57,855
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.

1011
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:00,775
I don't have an alternate future.

1012
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:04,487
I am going to kill this man.

1013
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:11,494
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1014
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:14,288
You still have a choice.

1015
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:17,708
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1016
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:25,299
Six years ago, Baltimore...

1017
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:29,262
...you grabbed a kid at Francis
public pool on the West End.

1018
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:33,808
Did I? I don't remember
anything about that place.

1019
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:39,730
Who am I? Who am I?

1020
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:41,899
Do you know who I am?

1021
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:45,611
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1022
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:48,698
Sean!

1023
01:44:49,574 --> 01:44:52,660
I told him I was a policeman
and needed his help.

1024
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:57,873
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1025
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,167
He was happy. He was happy.

1026
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:03,504
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?

1027
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:07,008
Is he all right?
Tell me， you fuck， where is he?!

1028
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:11,220
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1029
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,515
He floated back up. I took him out.

1030
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,893
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1031
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:20,688
I was gentle.

1032
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:31,032
I'm sorry.

1033
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:33,743
I'm so very sorry.

1034
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:38,414
How could you do that to my...?

1035
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:18,454
You can choose.

1036
01:46:37,182 --> 01:46:39,892
You have the right to remain silent.

1037
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:44,855
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law.

1038
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:48,025
You have the right to an attorney...

1039
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:52,613
...now and during any
further questioning.

1040
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,658
If you can't afford an attorney...

1041
01:46:57,828 --> 01:46:59,870
...we will appoint one.

1042
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:04,417
Do you understand these rights?

1043
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:07,586
You're not gonna kill me?

1044
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:14,677
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1045
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:21,600
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing.

1046
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:26,105
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1047
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:29,650
He? Who's he?

1048
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:32,695
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.

1049
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:37,158
He told me I'd be released if I went
along, and my family would be cared for.

1050
01:47:37,325 --> 01:47:40,536
If you did what?

1051
01:47:42,205 --> 01:47:45,708
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?

1052
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,587
If you killed my kid?

1053
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:53,549
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1054
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:56,469
What about the pictures?

1055
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:01,140
They're fake. He gave them to me.

1056
01:48:01,516 --> 01:48:03,976
Now, listen to me. You...

1057
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:07,229
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?

1058
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,399
I don't know.

1059
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,818
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:

1060
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:16,197
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1061
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:18,199
I tell you who，
and my family gets nothing.

1062
01:48:18,366 --> 01:48:20,576
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1063
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:23,078
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1064
01:48:23,246 --> 01:48:26,415
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.

1065
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:29,001
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1066
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:35,257
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1067
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,677
You're not gonna kill me.

1068
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:41,764
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!

1069
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:57,821
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!

1070
01:48:57,989 --> 01:49:00,282
What's happening down there?

1071
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:05,204
Murder!

1072
01:49:06,998 --> 01:49:08,457
Doesn't make sense.

1073
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:12,711
If you were a child killer，
would you leave these photos out?

1074
01:49:12,879 --> 01:49:14,964
Anderton might have found them.

1075
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:18,050
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.

1076
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:22,388
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.

1077
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,598
This is an orgy of evidence.

1078
01:49:24,766 --> 01:49:28,811
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?

1079
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,312
None.

1080
01:49:35,485 --> 01:49:37,444
This was all arranged.

1081
01:49:37,612 --> 01:49:42,700
<i>Today we saw the first murder in the</i>
<i>six years of the Precrime experiment.</i>

1082
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:45,578
<i>Sadly enough, this failure was human.</i>

1083
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:49,039
<i>The protection team</i>
<i>simply didn't get there in time.</i>

1084
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:54,295
<i>But the murder itself happened exactly</i>
<i>as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.</i>

1085
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:58,424
<i>Today's event put a human face</i>
<i>on the Precrime system.</i>

1086
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:02,970
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1087
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:06,765
Lamar?

1088
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:15,983
- What?
<i>- There's something wrong.</i>

1089
01:50:16,192 --> 01:50:20,237
<i>We're chasing the wrong man.</i>
<i>I don't wanna say over the phone.</i>

1090
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:22,197
<i>Meet me at Anderton's.</i>

1091
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:25,534
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1092
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:34,585
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1093
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:37,630
Please, sir.

1094
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:41,967
Tell me what you have.

1095
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:50,517
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1096
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:55,898
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1097
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:59,109
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1098
01:50:59,277 --> 01:51:01,570
Agatha's stream was missing.

1099
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:05,699
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

1100
01:51:05,867 --> 01:51:10,954
Anderton downloaded this directly
from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

1101
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:17,336
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1102
01:51:18,963 --> 01:51:23,550
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1103
01:51:23,885 --> 01:51:26,762
Moving away from shore.

1104
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:32,851
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1105
01:51:33,144 --> 01:51:35,062
Watch the water.

1106
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:41,276
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1107
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:46,031
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1108
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:49,785
Anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged.

1109
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:52,955
He told me about
the missing data stream.

1110
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:57,000
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.

1111
01:51:57,168 --> 01:51:58,836
It was inside of Agatha.

1112
01:51:59,003 --> 01:52:04,133
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1113
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:08,470
Danny, just tell me
what you're thinking.

1114
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:11,640
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1115
01:52:12,308 --> 01:52:13,475
How?

1116
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:18,439
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs
see the same murder more than once.

1117
01:52:18,606 --> 01:52:22,484
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu.

1118
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:26,196
We teach the techs to identify
and disregard them.

1119
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:31,994
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1120
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:36,957
What if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether?

1121
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,751
I don't understand.

1122
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,336
All you'd have to do is hire someone
to kill Anne Lively...

1123
01:52:41,504 --> 01:52:45,174
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict，
someone with nothing to lose.

1124
01:52:45,341 --> 01:52:48,218
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place...

1125
01:52:48,386 --> 01:52:53,348
...haloes the killer， takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...

1126
01:52:53,516 --> 01:52:57,561
...having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes...

1127
01:52:57,729 --> 01:53:01,523
...commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1128
01:53:01,691 --> 01:53:07,070
Technician takes a look, thinks he's
looking at an echo, erases it.

1129
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:16,413
It'd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place.

1130
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:18,707
Someone fairly high-up.

1131
01:53:20,877 --> 01:53:22,920
Do you know what I hear?

1132
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:28,008
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.

1133
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:32,429
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1134
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:34,056
Do you know why?

1135
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,684
Because right now,
the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.

1136
01:54:02,585 --> 01:54:05,921
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1137
01:54:06,381 --> 01:54:09,800
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1138
01:54:17,141 --> 01:54:19,101
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1139
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,812
<i>- Yes, Lara.</i>
- You have to help him.

1140
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:24,106
Is he there?

1141
01:54:25,066 --> 01:54:26,233
Yes.

1142
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:28,193
Is the Pre-Cog with him?

1143
01:54:31,072 --> 01:54:34,783
- Yes.
- Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1144
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:38,495
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1145
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:42,124
I won't say a word.

1146
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:46,837
You just don't let John leave,
all right?

1147
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:50,173
He's no killer, Lamar.

1148
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,009
I know.

1149
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:05,272
It's cold.

1150
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:13,280
Lara, this is Agatha.

1151
01:55:18,369 --> 01:55:23,749
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyerto you and Sean?

1152
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:32,007
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1153
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:36,803
I gotta sit down.

1154
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:42,517
I gotta figure this out.

1155
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,892
They used Sean.

1156
01:56:25,603 --> 01:56:28,480
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.

1157
01:56:29,607 --> 01:56:31,191
But he didn't.

1158
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:34,194
He didn't.

1159
01:56:35,905 --> 01:56:38,448
Why would they set you up?

1160
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:49,001
Because I found out about her.

1161
01:56:49,919 --> 01:56:51,712
About who?

1162
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:55,716
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1163
01:56:56,926 --> 01:56:58,969
Anne Lively.

1164
01:57:01,472 --> 01:57:03,015
Agatha.

1165
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:10,814
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...

1166
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:13,108
...they look on and help."

1167
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:16,111
Remember that, John.

1168
01:57:17,155 --> 01:57:18,321
Agatha.

1169
01:57:18,489 --> 01:57:20,115
Sean.

1170
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:26,747
He's on the beach now...

1171
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:29,624
...toe in the water.

1172
01:57:30,668 --> 01:57:33,545
He's asking you to come in with him.

1173
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:37,591
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1174
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:42,262
There's so much love in this house.

1175
01:57:47,268 --> 01:57:49,144
He's 10 years old.

1176
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:54,274
He's surrounded by animals.

1177
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,819
He wants to be a vet.

1178
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:04,367
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1179
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:07,746
He's in high school.

1180
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:11,083
He likes to run, like his father.

1181
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:14,920
He runs the two-mile
and the long relay.

1182
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:18,006
He's 23.

1183
01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:21,676
He's at a university.

1184
01:58:22,136 --> 01:58:25,347
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1185
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:27,974
He asks her to be his wife.

1186
01:58:28,476 --> 01:58:32,104
He calls here and tells Lara，
who cries.

1187
01:58:33,689 --> 01:58:35,690
He still runs...

1188
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:40,195
...across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1189
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:44,908
Oh, God. He's running so fast,
just like his daddy.

1190
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:49,704
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1191
01:58:51,207 --> 01:58:55,752
But he's only 6 years old,
and he can't do it.

1192
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:58,630
And the other man is so fast.

1193
01:59:02,468 --> 01:59:05,220
There was so much love in this house.

1194
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:08,765
I want him back so bad.

1195
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:13,061
So did she.

1196
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:15,522
Can't you see?

1197
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,571
She just wanted her little girl back.

1198
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,992
But it was too late.

1199
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:31,163
Her little girl was already gone.

1200
01:59:31,914 --> 01:59:33,498
She's still alive.

1201
01:59:35,084 --> 01:59:37,002
She didn't die.

1202
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,337
But she's not alive.

1203
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,632
Agatha?

1204
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:46,678
Just tell me...

1205
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:49,306
...who killed your mother?

1206
01:59:49,974 --> 01:59:52,100
Who killed Anne Lively?

1207
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:58,648
I'm sorry， John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1208
01:59:59,442 --> 02:00:01,610
- What?
- Run!

1209
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:20,128
I love you.

1210
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:23,798
- It's okay.
- You'II be fine with them.

1211
02:00:23,966 --> 02:00:26,801
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

1212
02:00:26,969 --> 02:00:29,429
- John， no.
- Don't talk.

1213
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:48,198
John Anderton.

1214
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:52,702
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...

1215
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:58,083
...l'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1216
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:02,837
That's it.

1217
02:01:03,297 --> 02:01:05,006
That's my girl.

1218
02:01:06,842 --> 02:01:09,177
I was so worried about you.

1219
02:01:13,182 --> 02:01:15,016
Did he hurt you?

1220
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:19,688
I missed you so much.

1221
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:22,107
It's okay. Wally's here.

1222
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,192
Wally's here.

1223
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:32,826
You're a part of my flock now， John.

1224
02:01:33,035 --> 02:01:34,536
Welcome.

1225
02:01:35,496 --> 02:01:40,041
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...

1226
02:01:40,209 --> 02:01:43,253
...that your life flashes
before your eyes...

1227
02:01:43,462 --> 02:01:46,881
...that all your dreams come true.

1228
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:05,984
This is all my fault.

1229
02:02:06,944 --> 02:02:09,571
There was nothing anyone could do.

1230
02:02:13,951 --> 02:02:16,745
I thought you might want
to have those.

1231
02:02:22,585 --> 02:02:27,672
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1232
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,132
You look great.

1233
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,595
I knew he was having trouble
for some time, yet I did nothing.

1234
02:02:33,763 --> 02:02:37,265
- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.

1235
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:40,935
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1236
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:47,025
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1237
02:02:47,234 --> 02:02:52,947
But this incident with John made me
realize the fragility of all this.

1238
02:02:53,532 --> 02:02:56,826
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1239
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:01,122
Now I have an obligation
to protect that.

1240
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:05,168
Lara, I know how difficult
this is for you.

1241
02:03:05,336 --> 02:03:08,755
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact...

1242
02:03:08,923 --> 02:03:13,385
...that John finally found
the man who killed your son.

1243
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:17,514
Who's Anne Lively?

1244
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:22,811
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1245
02:03:23,312 --> 02:03:27,190
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1246
02:03:27,358 --> 02:03:29,567
I don't know who that is.

1247
02:03:30,736 --> 02:03:35,949
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1248
02:03:36,117 --> 02:03:41,037
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1249
02:03:41,205 --> 02:03:45,792
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.

1250
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:50,171
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?

1251
02:03:50,339 --> 02:03:51,673
- Sean.
- Yes.

1252
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,802
He came here to work for you
because he thought...

1253
02:03:55,970 --> 02:04:00,557
...if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1254
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:04,477
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1255
02:04:04,645 --> 02:04:09,357
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1256
02:04:09,525 --> 02:04:10,692
Lara...

1257
02:04:11,193 --> 02:04:14,028
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

1258
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:17,073
...and, in some ways,
also the best man.

1259
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:19,701
But the scars he carried around...

1260
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:25,248
Well, I know he'd want us to honor
the good things we remember about him.

1261
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:31,129
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.

1262
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:35,675
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?

1263
02:04:35,843 --> 02:04:40,221
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.

1264
02:04:48,063 --> 02:04:50,899
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1265
02:04:51,066 --> 02:04:55,361
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1266
02:04:55,529 --> 02:04:59,199
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files...

1267
02:04:59,366 --> 02:05:02,410
...see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1268
02:05:02,578 --> 02:05:05,371
What did you say her name was?

1269
02:05:07,416 --> 02:05:09,167
Anne Lively.

1270
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:12,295
But I never said she drowned.

1271
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:36,986
- Sir， the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1272
02:05:41,659 --> 02:05:44,118
We'll talk about this later.

1273
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:49,457
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.

1274
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:28,746
I'd like a word with my husband.

1275
02:06:29,456 --> 02:06:32,500
You're not authorized.

1276
02:06:32,668 --> 02:06:35,378
How did you get in here?

1277
02:06:44,054 --> 02:06:45,388
Thank you.

1278
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:50,935
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1279
02:06:53,522 --> 02:06:57,442
On behalf of your staff,
we present you with this.

1280
02:06:57,610 --> 02:07:01,404
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1281
02:07:02,531 --> 02:07:04,032
How did you get this?

1282
02:07:04,199 --> 02:07:07,368
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1283
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:13,583
Revolvers like this one
were given to generals...

1284
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:16,961
...at the end of the Civil War
by their troops.

1285
02:07:17,129 --> 02:07:21,049
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets...

1286
02:07:21,216 --> 02:07:24,552
...to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death...

1287
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:27,221
...that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1288
02:07:27,389 --> 02:07:30,892
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national...

1289
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:35,063
...maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us...

1290
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:38,566
...will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1291
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:44,614
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1292
02:07:47,534 --> 02:07:51,788
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1293
02:07:54,583 --> 02:07:55,833
Hello.

1294
02:07:56,001 --> 02:07:58,503
Yes. Right away.

1295
02:07:58,754 --> 02:08:01,923
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

1296
02:08:02,091 --> 02:08:03,508
- Sir?
- Yes.

1297
02:08:03,676 --> 02:08:07,387
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1298
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:10,139
Yes, this is Burgess.

1299
02:08:10,307 --> 02:08:14,936
<i>Hello, Lamar. I just wanted</i>
<i>to congratulate you. You did it.</i>

1300
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,605
<i>You created a world without murder.</i>

1301
02:08:17,773 --> 02:08:20,942
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?

1302
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:23,569
<i>All you had to do was kill someone</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

1303
02:08:28,283 --> 02:08:29,325
A-room. Jad.

1304
02:08:30,327 --> 02:08:33,705
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1305
02:08:33,872 --> 02:08:38,459
- What are you talking about?
<i>- Agatha's mother, Anne Lively.</i>

1306
02:08:38,627 --> 02:08:42,964
<i>Just a junkie who had a kid once</i>
<i>and had to give her up, but surprise!</i>

1307
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:46,092
<i>She cleaned herself up,</i>
<i>and she wanted her daughter back.</i>

1308
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,219
<i>She wanted Agatha.</i>

1309
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:55,143
Jad, you getting this? It's from the
female only. No time or incident data.

1310
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:57,770
It isn't the future.
It already happened.

1311
02:08:57,938 --> 02:09:01,649
<i>And the problem was, without Agatha,</i>
<i>there was no Precrime.</i>

1312
02:09:01,817 --> 02:09:06,654
<i>She's the strongest of the three.</i>
<i>Without Agatha, you had nothing.</i>

1313
02:09:06,822 --> 02:09:12,201
<i>You wouldn't be where you are now,</i>
<i>standing there, signing autographs.</i>

1314
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:23,504
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?

1315
02:09:23,672 --> 02:09:27,300
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.

1316
02:09:27,468 --> 02:09:28,468
Slow down.

1317
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:53,743
<i>Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively,</i>
<i>which presented a problem:</i>

1318
02:09:53,911 --> 02:09:57,580
<i>How can you kill her</i>
<i>without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?</i>

1319
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:02,043
<i>Simple. Use a system</i>
<i>you control against her.</i>

1320
02:10:02,211 --> 02:10:07,423
<i>You hired someone to kill her, knowing</i>
<i>the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.</i>

1321
02:10:07,591 --> 02:10:11,177
<i>You lured Anne Lively</i>
<i>out to the lake...</i>

1322
02:10:11,345 --> 02:10:15,348
<i>... with the promise of reuniting her</i>
<i>with her daughter.</i>

1323
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:01,853
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

1324
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:10,278
<i>Where?</i>

1325
02:11:12,364 --> 02:11:13,614
Look!

1326
02:11:17,077 --> 02:11:18,160
Run!

1327
02:11:29,798 --> 02:11:33,134
<i>When you were all alone,</i>
<i>you killed her yourself...</i>

1328
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:37,305
<i>... in the same way the Pre-Cogs</i>
<i>predicted your John Doe would kill her.</i>

1329
02:11:37,472 --> 02:11:40,349
<i>You made the real murder</i>
<i>look like an echo...</i>

1330
02:11:40,517 --> 02:11:45,313
<i>... knowing the tech would do what</i>
<i>he was trained to do: Disregard it.</i>

1331
02:11:51,069 --> 02:11:55,489
<i>Anne Lively became</i>
<i>just another missing person.</i>

1332
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:59,327
<i>So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?</i>

1333
02:12:00,037 --> 02:12:01,996
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

1334
02:12:13,133 --> 02:12:14,467
We got a Red Ball!

1335
02:12:20,641 --> 02:12:26,604
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1336
02:12:26,772 --> 02:12:31,359
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.

1337
02:12:31,526 --> 02:12:34,070
Don't you ever say his name!

1338
02:12:36,323 --> 02:12:42,662
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1339
02:12:42,829 --> 02:12:45,831
You knew that would
drive me to murder.

1340
02:12:45,999 --> 02:12:49,377
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1341
02:12:49,544 --> 02:12:51,545
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?

1342
02:12:51,713 --> 02:12:54,048
Forgive me, John.

1343
02:13:02,391 --> 02:13:04,225
<i>Forgive me, John.</i>

1344
02:13:15,821 --> 02:13:17,113
Lamar.

1345
02:13:17,572 --> 02:13:18,948
It's over.

1346
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:24,912
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1347
02:13:38,093 --> 02:13:41,178
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have
already seen this.

1348
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:43,014
No doubt.

1349
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:46,308
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1350
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:51,439
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1351
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:56,027
If you do kill me, you go away...

1352
02:13:56,486 --> 02:14:00,948
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.

1353
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:10,458
So, what are you gonna do now?

1354
02:14:11,752 --> 02:14:13,753
What's it worth?

1355
02:14:14,546 --> 02:14:16,881
Just one more murder.

1356
02:14:19,718 --> 02:14:24,805
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but
people will still believe in Precrime.

1357
02:14:24,973 --> 02:14:29,060
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1358
02:14:32,397 --> 02:14:33,981
Except...

1359
02:14:34,816 --> 02:14:37,318
...you know your own future...

1360
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:41,155
...which means you can change it
if you want to.

1361
02:14:42,157 --> 02:14:45,242
You still have a choice, Lamar.

1362
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,536
Like I did.

1363
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:55,002
Yes, I have a choice...

1364
02:14:56,296 --> 02:14:58,297
...and I made it.

1365
02:14:59,174 --> 02:15:01,175
Forgive me, John.

1366
02:15:02,803 --> 02:15:04,553
Forgive me.

1367
02:15:09,851 --> 02:15:11,519
Forgive me, my boy.

1368
02:15:30,205 --> 02:15:31,789
Lamar!

1369
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:47,805
<i>In 2054, the six-year Precrime</i>
<i>experiment was abandoned.</i>

1370
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:58,732
<i>All prisoners were unconditionally</i>
<i>pardoned and released...</i>

1371
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:03,195
<i>... although police departments</i>
<i>kept watch on many of them for years.</i>

1372
02:16:50,952 --> 02:16:53,287
<i>Agatha and the twins...</i>

1373
02:16:53,455 --> 02:16:56,874
<i>... were transferred</i>
<i>to an undisclosed location...</i>

1374
02:16:57,709 --> 02:17:01,295
<i>... a place where they could</i>
<i>find relief from their gifts...</i>

1375
02:17:01,588 --> 02:17:05,591
<i>... a place where they could</i>
<i>live out their lives in peace.</i>
