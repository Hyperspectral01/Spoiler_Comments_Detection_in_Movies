2
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,101
Dark Star November,
this is Gator 6. Return to base.

3
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,703
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.

4
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:47,159
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

5
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,560
You look pale. Everything okay?

6
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,270
Sean?

7
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,530
Sean?

8
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,103
Hey.

9
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,706
Anyway, listen. I wanted to tell you.

10
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,612
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...

11
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,182
He's calling me three times a day.

12
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,448
I hear more from him now than I did
when we were together.

13
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,714
What is it with guys?

14
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,595
I gave notice.

15
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,190
- - Ticket?
- - Notice?

16
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,632
May I see your ticket?

17
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,860
I, uh...

18
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,074
Hey. Hey.

19
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,615
You're acting a little strange this morning.
You okay?

20
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,619
- Ticket?
- Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

21
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,743
We're gonna try, sir.

22
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,655
Hey, Grandpa,
what the heck was the delay back there?

23
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,751
I just punch the tickets, sir.

24
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,824
I should punch your face.

25
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,155
Sean? Did I do something?

26
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,257
Look, I can see that you think you know me,
but I don't know who you are.

27
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,804
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.

28
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,500
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army
in Afghanistan.

29
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,176
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

30
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,713
Sean, that's...

31
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,611
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

32
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,844
I feel sick.

33
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,521
- Damn it!
- - I'm sorry.

34
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,122
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.

35
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,888
Glenbrook Station.

36
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,766
Hey, mister!

37
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,071
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.

38
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,264
Hey!

39
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,931
You dropped this.

40
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,202
Thanks.

41
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,311
What is that?

42
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,413
Chicago.

43
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,890
All aboard.

44
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,420
Doors are closing.

45
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,668
This is a Chicago-bound train.

46
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,104
You okay there, Captain?

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,209
Next stop, Chicago.

48
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,954
Union Station.

49
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,319
Did you see that?

50
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,526
You're kind of freaking me out.

51
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,374
No.

52
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,976
No, no, no, no.

53
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,304
Are you all right?

54
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,472
I don't know what's going on.

55
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,636
Talk to me, Sean.

56
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,183
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.

57
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,817
Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.

58
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,718
We'll figure out
whatever's going on here, okay?

59
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,854
This doesn't belong to me.

60
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,625
Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay.

61
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,151
Captain
Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.

62
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,482
Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.

63
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,152
Acknowledge transmission.

64
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,299
Captain Stevens, do you copy?

65
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,836
Where am I?

66
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,533
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?

67
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm dizzy. Did I just A-lock?

68
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,541
Adjusting your rotation.

69
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,288
Can you report at this time?

70
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,685
What is this? What is this?

71
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,352
Where...

72
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,362
Who am I talking to?

73
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,988
Captain, report what you saw.

74
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,991
What? I don't understand.

75
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,865
Where were you
before you were talking to me?

76
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,972
There was an explosion.

77
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,167
Coming from where?

78
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,675
Some confusion is perfectly normal
at this stage, Captain.

79
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,208
Do you have a visual signal?

80
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,748
Who are you?

81
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,593
You already have that information, Captain.

82
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,597
- I do?
- Recall my name.

83
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,639
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.

84
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,747
I...

85
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,340
I was on a mission.

86
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,351
I was flying,

87
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,852
and then I woke up on a train.

88
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,922
And now I'm here.

89
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,021
I need to be briefed.

90
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,254
What unit is this?

91
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,727
You're with Beleaguered Castle.

92
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,021
Who?

93
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,259
Stand by for thread one
of alpha memory pattern.

94
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,165
What is Beleaguered Castle?

95
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,061
The exercises will assist you.

96
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,097
Memory thread one.

97
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,103
Listen to the following passage.

98
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,236
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and opera cloak.

99
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,476
"In her hand were five playing cards."

100
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,779
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,

101
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,786
"the queen of spades, four of clubs,

102
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,751
"nine of clubs,

103
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,052
"three of hearts, nine of hearts. "

104
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,724
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.

105
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,657
Thread two. The following is a recording
of a Western Screech Owl.

106
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,697
End of thread two.
End of pattern. Acknowledge.

107
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,933
Acknowledge end of pattern.

108
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,976
Stand by to initiate pattern recall.

109
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,341
Go for pattern recall.

110
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,936
Arrange the five playing cards

111
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,915
in order of descending value,
irrespective of suit.

112
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,116
- Queen, two nines, four and a three.
- That is correct.

113
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,814
The passage I read contained mention
of a woman's name.

114
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,946
What was that name?

115
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,854
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.

116
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,615
Recall my name.

117
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,994
Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.

118
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,261
That is correct. Welcome back, Captain.

119
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,315
Ma'am, I need to talk to my father.

120
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,617
Has anybody been notified
that I'm stateside?

121
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,018
Who bombed the train, Captain?

122
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,915
What?

123
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,013
Who bombed the train?

124
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,716
A woman kept calling me Sean.

125
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,920
That is incidental.

126
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,528
Think, Captain. Remember back.

127
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,357
Who bombed the train?

128
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,491
I don't know who bombed
the goddamn train.

129
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,368
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?

130
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,832
You will have eight minutes,
same as last time.

131
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,138
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?

132
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,575
I need to know where I am.

133
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,738
What is the location
and condition of my crew?

134
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,974
Does anybody know that I'm stateside?

135
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,183
You are obligated
to give me this information.

136
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,378
Start with the bomb.

137
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,852
Where is it? What does it look like?

138
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,851
What kind of explosive?
How is it detonated?

139
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,615
- Right.
- Find the bomb,

140
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,716
and you will find the bomber.

141
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,091
Find the bomb. Wait, no, I...

142
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:21,413
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

143
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,075
Okay. That's good.

144
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,379
And I signed up for an LSAT course.

145
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,552
Next thing you know,
I'll be moving to India to find myself.

146
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,645
LSAT.

147
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,521
Know any good gurus?

148
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,623
She got your shoe.

149
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,793
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?

150
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,063
It's the same train, but it's different.

151
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,099
Deep.

152
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,869
I hope it's different. I feel the same way.

153
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,440
What?

154
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,779
- - Do I have...
- - Bryan.

155
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,718
What is it with guys?
Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.

156
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,250
What is...

157
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,121
This looks so real.

158
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,596
I think it's gonna be really good for me
to get as far away from him as possible.

159
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,858
Unbelievable detail.

160
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,457
Ticket? May I see your ticket?

161
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,936
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

162
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,238
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.

163
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,078
- - Ticket?
- - The distraction.

164
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,979
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.

165
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,314
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

166
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,513
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?

167
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,456
Hey, Grandpa,
what the hell was the delay back there?

168
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,417
- What are you late for?
- What?

169
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,692
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

170
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,734
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.

171
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,826
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?

172
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,995
Yeah.

173
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,501
He is a comedian.

174
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,236
Sit down.

175
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,631
Freak.

176
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,774
Fans.

177
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,081
That's the guy.

178
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,777
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.

179
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,948
- We talked about him.

180
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,047
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

181
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,820
Glenbrook Station.

182
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,191
Yeah, but by 1:00
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

183
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,523
Damn it!

184
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,963
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,161
Just let me get it, okay?

186
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,103
Hey, mister!

187
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,542
Hey!

188
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,705
Hey! You dropped this.

189
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,844
Thanks.

190
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,099
All aboard.

191
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,594
Doors are closing.

192
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,979
This is a Chicago-bound train.

193
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,285
The explosion came from behind me.

194
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,353
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.

195
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,796
I got time for you.

196
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,731
Next stop, Chicago.

197
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,602
Union Station.

198
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,473
Holy shit.

199
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,728
Goodwin?

200
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,560
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?

201
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,360
Uh...

202
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,603
Should I...

203
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,733
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...

204
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,843
Okay, um...

205
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,710
I'm just gonna leave it.

206
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,446
Okay?

207
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,487
I'll be late.

208
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,506
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.

209
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,176
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,

210
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,618
I need all of you to turn off
any personal electronic devices

211
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,019
until we pull into the station, okay?

212
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,453
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.

213
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,756
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.

214
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,297
Thank you. It's just a precautionary
measure. Nothing to worry about.

215
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,864
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?

216
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,663
Sir? Sir.

217
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,097
Is there a problem here, sir?

218
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,606
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?

219
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,143
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?

220
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,200
- Sean?
- Turn it off.

221
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,307
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?

222
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,437
Hey!

223
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,645
Sean! What are you doing?

224
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,850
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.

225
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,713
That's not a good idea.

226
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,347
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.

227
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,584
He's not any more real than you are.

228
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,058
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?

229
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,322
Not gonna be a next time.

230
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,073
Stabilize.

231
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,286
Lower your pulse.

232
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,549
Did you find the bomb?

233
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,119
Yes.

234
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,499
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

235
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,468
It's not a concern, Captain.

236
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,302
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.

237
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,812
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

238
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,315
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.

239
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,543
That's irrelevant, Captain.

240
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,414
I want to talk to your commanding officer!

241
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,714
You can talk to him upon completion
of your mission.

242
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,758
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.

243
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,090
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!

244
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,258
You've been with us for two months.

245
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,868
Did you ID the bomber?

246
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,971
No. Where's my unit?

247
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,802
And under whose jurisdiction
is this simulation?

248
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,177
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

249
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:37,971
What lives?

250
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,482
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

251
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,884
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?

252
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,390
I need to be briefed.

253
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,568
Sir, I need to give him something.

254
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,961
That's fine. Go ahead.

255
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,232
Okay.

256
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,904
Get ready to send him back in.

257
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,411
We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do
all the profiles right now.

258
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,278
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time,

259
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,048
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,

260
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,589
killing everyone on board.

261
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,557
And that's the train that you've been on.

262
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,720
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.

263
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,362
A man named Sean Fentress
was on that train.

264
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,994
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.

265
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,800
Every second spent explaining things

266
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,842
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

267
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,937
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion

268
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,039
was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

269
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,609
Now, did you find the bomb?

270
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,988
In the restroom.

271
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,523
Ventilation panel above the sink.

272
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,458
Cell phone detonator.

273
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,355
Are we done?

274
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,861
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.

275
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,400
Good.

276
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:10,102
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended
at the moment of the explosion.

277
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,633
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.

278
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,010
So, one of those calls was made
by our bomber.

279
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,778
Do you remember a freight train passing by
just before the explosion?

280
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,512
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed

281
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,986
to engulf the passing freight train,

282
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,048
which means the bomber had to be watching
both trains when the call was made.

283
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,953
Fifty-two callers.

284
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,518
One of those is our bomber.

285
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,363
I want you to concentrate on the passengers
in your car. Get to know them.

286
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,496
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem

287
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,131
quiet or withdrawn.

288
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,869
Who seem nervous.

289
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,570
As always, you will have eight minutes.

290
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,810
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?

291
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,340
Yes.

292
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,681
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.

293
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,849
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.

294
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,290
Everything else is irrelevant.

295
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,452
Charge the drivers.

296
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,655
Okay. Has my father even...

297
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,569
I took your advice.

298
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,534
It was very good advice.

299
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,407
Watch it.

300
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,074
You're kind of quiet today.

301
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,640
Just got a lot on my mind.

302
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,707
Careful.

303
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,080
Yikes.

304
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,712
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

305
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,884
Ticket?

306
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,950
That was very kind of you.

307
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,399
You're very decent.

308
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,938
Thank you.

309
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,611
You're real.

310
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,040
Ticket?

311
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,474
- - How's everything today?
- - It's good.

312
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,018
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.

313
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,646
- I meant behavior on the train.

314
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,351
Does anything, anybody
seem strange to you?

315
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,052
You're a little strange.

316
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,392
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?

317
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,565
Are you drunk or something?

318
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,265
Come here.

319
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,301
Come here for a second.

320
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,332
Come on.

321
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,113
Think of it as a game.

322
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,381
A game?

323
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,314
Wow.

324
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,859
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.

325
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,829
That's what's so terrifying about them.

326
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,362
Maybe there's a team at work.

327
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:54,729
The sleeping giant in cahoots
with the minister and Denoff there.

328
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,907
Don't forget the sullen college kid.
He's the expendable one.

329
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,467
I bet they're all controlled by the conductor.

330
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:06,411
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.

331
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,850
You're funny.

332
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,513
Damn it.

333
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,783
What about that guy?

334
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,318
Deposition.

335
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,451
What about the woman
who's sitting across from him?

336
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,620
Hair appointment. Every Monday.
You know this.

337
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,186
You talk to these people more than I do.

338
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,164
Right, right. And the guy behind her,

339
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,633
he's late for an audition, right?

340
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,796
That or a court appearance.

341
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,033
- That's the guy that was cited twice for DUI.
- For DUI. I know.

342
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,007
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.

343
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,937
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

344
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,572
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you
anymore, Sherlock?

345
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,444
Uh-oh.

346
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,785
Now we've slipped into racial profiling land.

347
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,188
Did anyone else come out
of that bathroom today?

348
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,224
Well,
I saw you coming out of there.

349
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,588
- Me?
- Yes.

350
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,631
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

351
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,824
Me?

352
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,527
Hey, mister!

353
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,761
- Hey.
- Hold on.

354
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,736
Hold on a second. Just hold on a second.

355
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,136
There's gotta be something in here.

356
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,800
- - You dropped this.
- - Gotta be something in here.

357
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,374
A broken phone? What is this?

358
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,079
Glenbrook Station.

359
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,210
Christina?

360
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,913
Yeah.

361
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,748
Excuse me.

362
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,584
Glenbrook Station.

363
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,328
Hey. Hey, come with me.

364
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,228
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on. Let's take a walk.

365
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,267
- We don't get off here.
- I know. We'll just be spontaneous.

366
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,392
You're kind of freaking me out.

367
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,006
I know this is gonna sound really weird,

368
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,978
but I have a really bad feeling
about this train,

369
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,447
and I think that we should get off. Okay?

370
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,748
- Just get your stuff.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.

371
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,925
Come on. Come with me.

372
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,493
So, what now?

373
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,229
Wait for me, right here. I'll be right back.

374
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,040
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie

375
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,842
will be leaving in 15 minutes from track two.

376
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:47,768
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in...

377
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,585
Hey.

378
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,358
You ready to get that coffee now?

379
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,962
Sorry, yeah. Just one more second, okay?

380
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,844
Oh, for God's sake.

381
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,507
Feeling sick?

382
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,323
It's motion sickness. I get it all the time.

383
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,628
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?

384
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,535
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?

385
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,430
No. I don't have one.

386
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,201
Sure?

387
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,536
Yeah, I'm sure.

388
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,737
Look, why don't you leave me alone, please.
Or I'll call the police.

389
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,404
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.

390
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,879
You know, you have no right.

391
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,250
What are you doing? Give me my bag back!

392
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,488
Are you crazy?

393
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,822
- - Where are they?
- - Sean?

394
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,889
Get back!

395
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,299
Sean, what are you doing?

396
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,165
Sean, what's going on?

397
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,939
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?

398
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,137
Sean! Sean!

399
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,775
It wasn't you.

400
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,948
What the hell's wrong with you?

401
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,149
- No!
- Are you insane?

402
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,454
No! No! No!

403
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,284
- - Where is the phone?
- Stop it!

404
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,522
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?

405
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,029
Get away from me, please!

406
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,302
Sean. Sean! Get up! Sean?

407
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,668
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me! Get up!

408
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,830
- - Sean! Sean!
- Give me your hand! Get off the track!

409
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,409
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!

410
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,270
Sean! Sean!

411
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,855
Cold.

412
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,461
Goodwin?

413
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,930
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?

414
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,905
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Do you copy? Please respond.

415
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,045
It's freezing in here. What's going on?

416
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,018
What was that?

417
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,320
He's in trouble.

418
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,858
I think the oxygen just went out.

419
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:36,796
Goodwin?

420
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,901
Goodwin!

421
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,011
Find a way to get through to him.

422
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,797
What is it?

423
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,604
What's going on?

424
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,248
It's not the tertiary cooling, either.

425
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,593
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.

426
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,101
It's hard to say exactly
what he's going through.

427
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,946
- Sir?
- Please!

428
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,144
There's not a whole lot
we can do from here.

429
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,126
If nothing changes,
how much time does he have?

430
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,631
Some.

431
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,258
But not a lot.

432
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,391
(DISTORTED)
There are four principal dialects of Arabic.

433
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,801
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese
and North African.

434
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:50,432
We will now play you portions of each,
discussing their differences.

435
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,691
Lilly awoke
in an evening dress and opera cloak.

436
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,886
In her hand were five playing cards.

437
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,657
They were the queen of spades,
the four of clubs...

438
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:23,996
Goodwin, you out there?

439
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,210
Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?

440
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,044
This is Captain Stevens. Do you copy?

441
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,415
Captain Stevens?

442
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,953
The capsule lost power.

443
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,215
The capsule?

444
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,851
Is that where you are right now, Captain?
In a capsule?

445
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,590
You should know. Who are you?

446
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,892
Let me get Captain Goodwin. Get Goodwin.

447
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,362
You invented this thing, right?

448
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,428
- I did.
- Wait. Are you in command here?

449
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,227
I am. Were you able to locate the information
we need, Captain?

450
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,334
That's a negative, sir.

451
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:01,674
I was unable to find the bomber,
but I did save a passenger on the train.

452
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,236
I got her off safely. A woman.

453
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,250
Captain? It's gonna be counterproductive
for you to try to save anyone on that train.

454
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,546
They are outside the mission.

455
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,183
But she survived.

456
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,517
And maybe the rest could, too.

457
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,716
She survived,
but only inside the source code.

458
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:15,816
None of them can be saved.

459
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,588
What is the source code?

460
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,460
It's quantum mechanics. Parabolic calculus.

461
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,364
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.

462
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,630
Fine.

463
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,568
When a light bulb is turned off,
there's an after-glow,

464
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,768
a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?

465
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,968
- Yes.
- Of course.

466
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,916
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged,

467
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:42,111
just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.

468
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,251
Now, there's another peculiarity
about the brain.

469
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,018
It contains a short-term memory track

470
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,752
that's approximately eight minutes long.

471
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,257
Like a convenience store security camera

472
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,696
that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.

473
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,563
Now, in combining these two phenomena,

474
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,199
circuitry that remains viable post-mortem

475
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,762
and a memory bank
that goes back eight minutes,

476
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,173
source code enables us to capitalize
on the overlap.

477
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,141
Sean Fentress died on that train.

478
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,441
Of all the passengers aboard,

479
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,973
he was your best link.
You two share compatibility

480
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,886
in terms of gender, body-size,
and your synaptic maps.

481
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,650
What happens after the eight minutes?

482
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:24,085
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.

483
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:29,123
You cannot exist inside the source code
beyond Fentress's eight minutes.

484
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,771
Source code is not time travel.

485
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,468
Rather, source code is time reassignment.

486
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,479
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

487
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,879
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy,

488
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,348
but source code empowers us...

489
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,614
No, but I saved one person.

490
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,247
That girl that's always sitting
across from me.

491
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,053
I pulled her off the train.

492
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,889
Give me her name.

493
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,620
Christina. I don't remember her last name.

494
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,497
Her name was Christina Warren.

495
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,704
- Yes.
- She was 28.

496
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,075
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.

497
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,306
Died this morning on the train.

498
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,111
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.

499
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,209
No, she isn't.

500
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,715
Believe me. She is.

501
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,144
Believe me!

502
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,487
She saw me get hit by the express train.

503
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,456
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.

504
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,657
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

505
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,755
What second attack?

506
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,927
The train was just the beginning,
a letter of intent.

507
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,501
What aren't you telling me here?

508
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,366
We have information
that downtown Chicago is the next target,

509
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,638
and they're planning to detonate
a dirty bomb.

510
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,109
Do you have any idea
how many people would die

511
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,706
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?

512
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,177
We're evacuating as we speak.

513
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,845
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?

514
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,651
If you find the bomber,
his second attack,

515
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,249
the real attack, we think, can be prevented.

516
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,060
We have very little time left. Out here,
the clocks only move in one direction.

517
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,431
Charge the drivers.

518
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,400
On the upper deck of the next
carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.

519
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,761
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

520
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,136
Inside is a loaded handgun.

521
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,404
Get to it. You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

522
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,305
(ECHOING) I took your advice.

523
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,685
It was very good advice.

524
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,958
You're still here.

525
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,086
Of course I am.

526
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,151
Guess what?

527
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,490
You quit your job
and you enrolled in an LSAT course.

528
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,357
Good guess.

529
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,558
Soda can.

530
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,193
Coffee spill.

531
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,072
Listen to me.

532
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,036
Don't answer this.

533
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,603
You deserve better than that guy.

534
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,909
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?

535
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,747
- - Ticket?
- - How did you know that was...

536
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,611
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.

537
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,313
- - How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...

538
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,649
Not that well, apparently.

539
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,587
Do you know me well enough
that if I did something that looked

540
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,420
a little strange
and was maybe even a little bit dangerous,

541
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,551
but I told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

542
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,290
No.

543
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,928
Wow. That was honest.

544
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,635
You're beautiful. You're kind.

545
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,801
And you're painfully honest.

546
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,733
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?

547
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,244
It's the new me.

548
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,727
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

549
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,239
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

550
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,913
Ticket?

551
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,599
Glenbrook Station.

552
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,053
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.

553
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,659
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat,
all right? He's bleeding.

554
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,131
He needs medical attention.

555
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,501
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun
out of the train's security box?

556
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,095
Careful, ma'am.

557
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,774
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?

558
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,572
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.

559
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,615
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?

560
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,188
What would you do
if you only had a minute left to live?

561
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,251
I don't know.

562
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,958
I would call my dad.

563
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,331
I would hear his voice,

564
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,196
and I'd tell him I was sorry.

565
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,508
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

566
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,147
Everything's gonna be okay.

567
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,694
Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox,
that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

568
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,693
Did you make any progress?

569
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,560
Can I get access to a phone?

570
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,706
I need to talk to my father.

571
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,770
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.

572
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,741
Goodwin, how am I doing?

573
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,580
I'm just trying
to measure my performance here.

574
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,521
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?

575
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,254
We are wasting valuable time here.

576
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,432
No, no.

577
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,633
I have never been on the other side
of a source code mission.

578
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,643
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?

579
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,269
CAOC-N. What is that?

580
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,747
Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

581
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,916
What are they?

582
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,079
Captain, you should have found a suspect
by now.

583
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,256
This tactical advantage,
this tremendous tool that we've given you,

584
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,021
don't squander it thinking. Do.

585
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,294
Please contact my father for me.

586
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,435
This will stop at some point, Captain.

587
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,827
As soon as you finish the mission.

588
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,236
And you're doing really great.

589
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,366
And this will end.

590
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,373
Now, whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.

591
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,748
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get
into the overhead vent,

592
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,808
flashlight, something.

593
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,815
Check bags and backpacks,
briefcases, anything.

594
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,029
So, I took your advice.

595
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,387
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...

596
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,944
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.

597
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,952
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.

598
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,819
Were you in the military?

599
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,948
A friend of mine was.

600
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:13,690
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared,
and no one's heard from him since.

601
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,502
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

602
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,128
No.

603
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:25,099
It's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

604
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,806
Do you think you can see
what you could find on this guy?

605
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,110
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.

606
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,844
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.

607
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,743
Okay. You owe me.

608
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,452
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

609
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,854
Why don't I get one for you now?

610
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,392
Okay. Christina?

611
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,183
Um...

612
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,357
I've been having these dreams lately.

613
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,267
Really vivid.

614
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,226
And you've been in them.

615
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,330
Really?

616
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,002
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...

617
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,567
It's just...

618
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,366
Um...

619
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:29,130
I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah.

620
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,003
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.

621
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,669
For what?

622
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,208
Psych. And I got a big test this morning,
so I should get back to it.

623
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,410
Can I borrow a pen?

624
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,221
Yeah, sure.

625
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,326
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!

626
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,155
Hey, your bag is a mess.

627
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,098
What are you doing, man?

628
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,829
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.

629
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,200
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?

630
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,568
Finish your deal.

631
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,574
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.

632
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,408
This guy.

633
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,538
Don't do that.

634
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,877
Nothing. What am I doing?

635
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,945
Jesus.

636
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,643
Dick.

637
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,779
CAOC-N.

638
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,724
- - Can you believe that?
- - Asshole.

639
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,798
Excuse me, ma'am?

640
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,338
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.

641
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,432
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.

642
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,776
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?

643
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,244
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...

644
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,508
Then what was going on down there?

645
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,848
Oh, you know, uh...

646
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:54,254
We were just having a little bit
of an argument, actually, about this patch.

647
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,315
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?

648
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,556
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters,
they look familiar to you?

649
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,722
Do you know what the "N" stands for?

650
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,099
It's Air Force, and the "N" stands for Nellis.

651
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,467
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

652
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,733
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?

653
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,732
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.

654
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,905
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.

655
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,880
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.

656
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,144
All right. Thank you so much.

657
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,428
This is a Chicago-bound train.

658
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,290
Next stop, Chicago,

659
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,732
Union Station.

660
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,063
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

661
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,400
Post Operator.

662
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:54,041
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.

663
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,083
Name, please?

664
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,246
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.

665
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,223
- - Hold the line.
- All aboard.

666
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,622
Doors are closing.

667
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,218
Dr. Rutledge
will be on in a moment.

668
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,164
I have to tell you something.

669
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,929
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?

670
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:16,234
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...

671
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,401
He's dead, Sean.

672
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,202
What?

673
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,744
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed
in action two months ago.

674
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,248
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.

675
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,843
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.

676
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,388
It was on the first site I tried.

677
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,420
His father's name is Donald, right?

678
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,660
This is from last week.

679
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,495
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss

680
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,798
"the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens,

681
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,031
"who died in Afghanistan in February,

682
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,098
"and was honored posthumously
with a silver star.

683
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,035
"Also on the broadcast
will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,

684
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,978
"whose life was saved by Captain Stevens

685
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,778
"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."

686
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:04,943
I'm sorry.

687
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,514
(ECHOING) Captain?

688
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,593
Sean? Talk to me.

689
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,563
Captain?

690
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,534
Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

691
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,537
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.

692
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:25,931
Hey, this guy's crashing!

693
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,473
Captain, just tell me what you see.
Just look and speak.

694
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,312
I see a card.

695
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,578
That's good.

696
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,450
Do you copy?
We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.

697
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,616
That's very good.

698
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,161
Am I dead?

699
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,205
A radio listing is saying that I died
in a helicopter crash, in country,

700
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,407
and my father received a medal for me.

701
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,074
Your condition's not the issue here.

702
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,849
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attack.

703
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,478
Everything else is irrelevant.

704
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,715
A news report saying that I'm dead
is irrelevant?

705
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:19,485
Until the person or persons
who blew up that train are in custody, yes.

706
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,493
Goodwin,

707
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,329
one soldier to another, am I dead?

708
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,150
Part of your brain remains activated.

709
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,512
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.

710
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,715
They still move.

711
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,947
They are a manifestation.

712
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,392
They're just your way of making sense
of all this.

713
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,221
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?

714
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:01,563
I'm imagining that I'm still alive,
that I'm in this capsule?

715
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,710
We have core temp dropping.

716
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:39,966
Captain, what just happened?

717
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:47,875
I asked you a question.

718
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,454
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

719
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,582
Where am I?

720
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:57,415
That's classified.

721
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,821
Fuck you!

722
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,636
Captain, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

723
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,799
But if we're to prevent a second attack,
we need to send you back immediately.

724
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,311
And, Captain,
you cannot deviate from the mission

725
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,607
while inside the source code,

726
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,045
even to investigate your...

727
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,450
Even to investigate what happened to you.

728
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,245
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can't be unsettled.

729
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,184
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

730
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,193
Just before the explosion,
so at 7:46 this morning,

731
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,824
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train,

732
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,700
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.

733
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,238
If the call even went through,

734
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,399
it would be received
by a different me entirely.

735
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:51,607
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

736
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,775
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.

737
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:58,343
And that represents the entirety
of your function here.

738
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,083
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!

739
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,847
I'll see if that makes an impression!

740
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:06,555
You cannot alter the continuum
of this reality from within the source code.

741
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,426
This can't be legal, what you're doing.

742
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,025
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself

743
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,764
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by military court.

744
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:21,637
Many soldiers would find this
preferable to death.

745
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,169
The opportunity to continue
serving their country.

746
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,578
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?

747
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,716
That's immaterial.

748
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,050
Any soldier I've ever served with would say
that one death is service enough.

749
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,428
Fine. You can have that in return
for completing this mission.

750
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,729
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.

751
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,763
Terminate your service. Let you die.

752
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,130
This is taking too long.

753
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,670
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.

754
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,476
I am certain we can find other servicemen

755
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,780
with wounds similar to yours
who would consider

756
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,117
being a part of this program an honor.

757
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,280
What? No, wait, what?

758
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,482
Send him back.

759
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,587
Charge the drivers.

760
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,631
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember

761
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,571
that it's not only about you,
but it's also about

762
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,269
two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,

763
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,239
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.

764
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,370
Your advice.

765
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,205
Hey, Grandpa.

766
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,327
Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?

767
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,568
There are hundreds of people on that train.

768
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,496
Well, then check them out one by one.

769
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,001
It doesn't matter what you do to them.
They're already dead.

770
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,236
Get to that gun,
and shoot someone if you have to.

771
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,074
But get us some usable intel.

772
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:04,871
No, wait!

773
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,259
We have to keep doing this
until you find the bomber.

774
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,457
Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.

775
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:23,823
Who is the bomber?

776
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,193
I'm trying.

777
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:34,072
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're exhausted,
and we're all frustrated,

778
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,510
but we cannot fail. You can do this.

779
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,080
I can't. I can't.

780
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,683
Yes, you can.

781
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,878
You're a born hero, son.

782
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,876
Even your father thinks so.

783
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,885
Saving people is what you do best.

784
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,721
It was about his third tour.

785
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,659
-I didn't want him to go back.
-Dad?

786
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,393
I just started feeling like
he didn't want to come home anymore.

787
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,731
-Dad?
-Like somehow, he couldn't come home.

788
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,402
And he wouldn't talk to me,
wouldn't hear me.

789
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,877
Finally he said he just couldn't leave
his unit out there without him,

790
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,275
and that was that.

791
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,240
Those guys were his family.

792
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,018
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I don't know,

793
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,849
I never fully understood him.

794
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,188
And I can't believe he's gone.

795
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,991
Send me back in.

796
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,930
Please don't blow me up again.

797
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,366
Hello?

798
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,026
I know it's you.

799
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,229
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

800
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,637
I'm gonna find you. Turn around.

801
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,802
- Hey, there.
- Me?

802
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,945
Why do you look so surprised?

803
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,846
Don't.

804
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,855
Move. I said move. Move.
Put your bag over there.

805
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:03,950
- Okay.
- Move over.

806
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,494
- Put the bag over there and move over.
- Okay, okay.

807
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,725
Move over. Move over.
Now hand me your phone.

808
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,934
- You're done. You're done.
- What?

809
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:13,532
You can't kill anybody anymore.

810
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,101
What? I don't understand.

811
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,729
You were going to trigger the bomb
with your phone.

812
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:21,175
What? Dude, I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

813
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:26,371
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?

814
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,144
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.

815
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,286
Try it again.

816
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,182
Your call. Dial it again.

817
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,857
Okay. I'm gonna press redial.

818
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,396
Your phone is gonna ring,
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

819
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,966
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

820
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,132
Hey!

821
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,204
You dropped this.

822
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:57,302
Wow. Thanks.

823
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,346
Hey!

824
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:31,078
All aboard. Doors are closing.

825
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,846
Shit! No! No!

826
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,845
No!

827
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:40,886
Wait!

828
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,554
No! Come on!

829
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,237
Stop the train!

830
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:26,694
Hey!

831
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,366
Hey!

832
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,712
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?

833
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,147
- See this?
- Yes.

834
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,382
- You recognize it?
- No.

835
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,657
Jesus.

836
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,658
How about you give me your wallet?

837
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,526
Okay.

838
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:02,336
You left it on the train deliberately.

839
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,175
I must have dropped it.

840
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,703
No.

841
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,111
You planted it there,
so everybody would think you were dead.

842
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,213
I know it's you.

843
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,382
How do you know so much?

844
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,291
What the hell is that thing?

845
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!

846
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,702
Do you wanna see it?

847
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,601
Very patriotic.

848
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,037
Slowly, slowly!

849
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,678
All right, all right!
Back up! Back up! Back up!

850
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,819
Not many people could build that.

851
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,337
All right. Where is your next target?

852
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:11,662
Sean?

853
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,677
Oh, my God!

854
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,603
Sean Fentress?

855
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:52,775
Teacher.

856
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:54,944
History.

857
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,148
I don't know you.

858
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,450
I think I killed your girlfriend.

859
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,120
Why?

860
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,787
You messed up my timing.

861
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,327
- Why?
- Oh.

862
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,097
You mean "Why this?"

863
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:19,735
Because the world is hell.

864
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,677
But we have a chance to start over
in the rubble.

865
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,210
But first there has to be rubble.

866
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,078
You're a teacher, you understand.

867
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,647
Christina.

868
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,384
Stay with me. Stay with me.

869
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,954
Everything's gonna be okay.

870
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,302
This isn't the end.

871
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,137
Check through there. I'll go check this way.

872
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,449
- - Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.

873
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:24,897
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

874
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,502
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

875
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,945
I have your bomber. I have his name.

876
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,948
You have the bomber's name?

877
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,111
Derek Frost.

878
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:56,428
He got into a rented white van
in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.

879
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,765
Illinois plates, five, Charlie,
Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.

880
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,004
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.

881
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,240
All right, let's move.

882
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:10,168
And Goodwin, there is
a radioactive device in the van.

883
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,907
Some kind of bomb.

884
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,037
Thank you, Captain.

885
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,207
Yes, ma'am.

886
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,884
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.

887
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,182
About our deal?

888
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:24,659
I had hoped that you might reconsider that,
for the sake of the program.

889
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,091
I have. I want something else now.

890
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,024
Good.

891
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,664
I still wanna die.

892
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,662
But I want to go back in

893
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,830
and I wanna save all those people
on that train first.

894
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,170
It doesn't work that way. It can't.

895
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,834
No, I know. I know, I know.

896
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,439
I'm not really asking you to believe me, sir.
I'm just...

897
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,711
I'm asking you
to have the decency to let me try.

898
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,951
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.

899
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,453
Van is approaching fence gate
to the quarry. Over.

900
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:00,723
Roger that, AU SWAT-1.
- Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.

901
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,526
We'll stop him about halfway down. Over.

902
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:08,731
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road. Over.

903
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,601
AU SWAT-2, roger that.

904
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,502
We're going to switch
now to a live feed from our Chicago affiliate.

905
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,273
The SWAT team
is approaching the white van.

906
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,712
The Illinois man has been sought
since early this morning.

907
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,613
The door is open
and the man is on the ground.

908
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,084
It appears he has surrendered.

909
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,419
Earlier today,
the police discovered...

910
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,822
Congratulations, Captain.

911
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,988
In recent months, Frost started posting
anti-government statements on his website.

912
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,197
Yes, sir, it's a real validation
of the program.

913
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,963
A clear window into
just how revolutionary source code can be.

914
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,564
We finally have a powerful weapon now
in the war on terror.

915
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:48,004
Congratulations, Captain. A job well done.

916
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,407
He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

917
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,841
I'm still waiting on an answer.

918
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,751
Are you married, Captain?

919
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,350
Um...

920
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,854
Joe?

921
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:07,593
Why don't you go take a break?

922
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:10,257
-You deserve to celebrate.
-Sure.

923
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,493
Can I get you something?

924
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,326
No, I'm fine.

925
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,101
Why? Are you asking me on a date?

926
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,665
Sorry. Poor taste.

927
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,938
- Are you married?
- Hmm?

928
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:24,837
No.

929
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,171
I am divorced.

930
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,882
Do you think
there's an alternate version of you?

931
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,250
A Goodwin who made different choices?

932
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,085
What do you mean?

933
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,094
Like, a you who didn't get married
and get divorced.

934
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,393
Or just married someone else.

935
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,694
A woman who took
a different fork in the road.

936
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,804
No, I don't, Captain.

937
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,633
What you experienced was a shadow.

938
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,004
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.

939
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,440
This is real life. Here.

940
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,850
The one where you're talking to
a dead helicopter pilot?

941
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,926
The program wasn't designed
to alter the past.

942
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:17,588
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.

943
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,861
I missed something, Captain.

944
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:22,198
That train shouldn't have blown up.

945
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,761
There must have been a second detonator,

946
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,363
something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.

947
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,877
It's a computer program, Captain.

948
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:34,074
The girl on the train, all the others,
they're lost.

949
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,617
I'm sorry about that.

950
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,016
I get it. I get it.

951
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,479
I know.
Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.

952
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,058
You're wrong, Goodwin.

953
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,025
You're just plain wrong.

954
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,953
Captain, Christina is dead.

955
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,763
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.

956
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,396
Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.

957
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,330
I'm asking you,

958
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,673
I'm asking you. Just...

959
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,301
Send me...

960
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,531
Captain.

961
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,799
It's your choice.

962
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:10,171
At the end of this source code,
I will terminate your life support.

963
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,482
There will be no coming back.

964
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,516
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.

965
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:28,820
It was an honor, Captain.

966
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,434
And I thank you for your service.

967
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,302
Good luck.

968
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,481
I took your advice.

969
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,823
You're gonna move to India,
and become a guru.

970
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,689
- Careful, ma'am.

971
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,856
Yeah, I'm gonna go
find myself in the mountains.

972
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,800
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee
with me before you go.

973
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:11,606
Yeah. I'd like to do that. Put it to the test.

974
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:13,434
Good.

975
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,803
Let's do it today.

976
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,939
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.

977
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,151
- You know what?
- What?

978
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,752
I feel really good.

979
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,650
Why?

980
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,853
Because I've been waiting for weeks
for you to ask me for coffee.

981
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,265
Ticket?

982
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,434
Okay.

983
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:50,140
Just give me a couple minutes, okay?
And I'll be right back.

984
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,237
Gotta go save the world.

985
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,352
I knew he was a keeper.

986
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,713
Excuse me!

987
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,889
Beautiful day.

988
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,121
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

989
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,055
Ticket?

990
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,563
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

991
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,031
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

992
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,795
- - You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.

993
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,237
Yeah, well, sure.

994
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,572
Look, if we can get the funding,
I guarantee we can have at least...

995
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:59,975
Eight source code projects up and running
by the end of the year.

996
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,574
- Really? That many?
- Maybe more.

997
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,118
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.

998
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:05,951
Well, thank you.

999
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,689
We did save lives today.

1000
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,725
Yes, a true victory for the program.

1001
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,317
A great victory for us all.

1002
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:14,021
We'll talk soon.

1003
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,694
So? Exciting times.

1004
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,867
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1,

1005
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,669
start crunching the data.

1006
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:25,635
Sir,

1007
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,743
we told Captain Stevens

1008
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,279
that we were gonna let him die.

1009
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,838
Let him die?

1010
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:36,615
He just saved millions of lives today.

1011
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,915
How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?

1012
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,080
For all we know, he may be

1013
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,319
the only candidate
with which the system works.

1014
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,488
So,

1015
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,930
let's clear his memory

1016
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,121
and reinitialize source code.

1017
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,065
Shall we?

1018
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,471
Yes, sir.

1019
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,346
Sorry, I just dropped...

1020
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,077
Hey, Derek! This isn't your stop.

1021
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,641
Hey, mister!

1022
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,881
You dropped this.

1023
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,857
Come on back here.

1024
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,316
Oops.

1025
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,219
Derek,

1026
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,123
it's over.

1027
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,531
You understand?

1028
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,170
Hey. My name is Derek Frost.

1029
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,434
I planted a nuclear device in a white van

1030
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,936
parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR
parking lot.

1031
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,707
Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole

1032
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:15,409
on the 944 CCR train
headed to Chicago Union Station.

1033
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,747
I am a sick and pathetic human being.

1034
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:22,487
And I need to be locked away
for a very long time.

1035
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:26,253
Okay.

1036
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,497
Derek,

1037
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,496
there's no more
burying the world in rubble today.

1038
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,731
You mind if I borrow this?

1039
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,678
Captain, some of the guys and I
are gonna go celebrate.

1040
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,803
And...

1041
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:51,216
Do you want me to initiate
the memory wipe, Captain?

1042
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,275
Hello, Captain.

1043
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,796
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?

1044
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:36,888
Yes?

1045
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,434
My name is Sean Fentress.

1046
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,702
Who?

1047
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:49,335
I served with your son, Colter.

1048
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,677
- Oh, boy.
- It's...

1049
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:00,446
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call you.

1050
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:06,054
Sometimes it just takes a while to figure out
what you want to say. You know?

1051
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:11,661
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I imagine it's not an easy call to make.

1052
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,073
How are you doing, sir?

1053
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,011
Well, all that came back was some ash.

1054
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,843
It's hard to believe that it was him.

1055
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,186
How well did you know him?

1056
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,364
I was there when he died, sir.

1057
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:50,466
He said

1058
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:56,742
that the last time
that you guys talked was tough,

1059
01:16:58,647 --> 01:16:59,739
and

1060
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,745
he wanted to say that he was sorry.

1061
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,448
I just want him back.

1062
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,016
I loved him so much.

1063
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,051
I wish you could have told him that.

1064
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,299
He knows it.

1065
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,764
You take care, Mr. Stevens.

1066
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:27,358
You okay?

1067
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,360
Yeah.

1068
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:32,998
Save the world?

1069
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:34,964
Sort of.

1070
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,942
So, where were we?

1071
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:41,611
Getting some coffee.

1072
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,108
Dr. Rutledge.

1073
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,344
What?

1074
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,727
Shit.

1075
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,199
What's so damn hard about it?
I run a business, okay?

1076
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:04,795
Everything moves on time
or people get fired.

1077
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,306
That's the way it works in the real world.

1078
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,706
- Ten minutes..
- Hey, buddy?

1079
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,836
Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll drown.

1080
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,015
Thank you for that moment of Zen,
but nobody was talking to you.

1081
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,917
What, are you selling self-help CDs today?
Why don't you just mind your own business.

1082
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:23,490
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here
this instant!

1083
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,853
Why are you always so bitter, Max?

1084
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:30,889
It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What do you want from me?

1085
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,734
It doesn't have to be.

1086
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:40,171
I will bet you $100 you can't make
all these people on this train laugh.

1087
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,142
--Oh. Right.

1088
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,977
Actually, you know what? 126 bucks.

1089
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:52,710
Is that your way of making fun of me?

1090
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,312
I guess you have a better gig. Never mind.

1091
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:55,981
No, no. I'm good.

1092
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,725
Easiest money ever.

1093
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,318
- Come on.
- - Excuse me, people.

1094
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:06,028
One of our fellow passengers has decided to
offer me some money to...

1095
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,628
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.

1096
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:12,002
- It's the new me.
- I like it.

1097
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:17,036
I am going to prosecute you
to the full extent of the law.

1098
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,270
Women always mess up my last name.

1099
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,976
I was with a girl the other night
and she kept calling me "Getoff."

1100
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,315
She was like, "Getoff! Getoff!"
I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff."

1101
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,753
She says,
"No, you're fat and you're heavy. Get off!"

1102
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,524
Good?

1103
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,151
Twenty seconds.

1104
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:34,695
Make it ten.

1105
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:37,754
Goodwin?

1106
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,637
-Look at all this.

1107
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:45,069
It's good to see you, ladies,
up this early in the morning.

1108
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,835
- What?
- Michelle. Barack.

1109
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,805
All this life.

1110
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:00,521
Goodwin. Open this door.

1111
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,963
Put those headphones on.
I wanna see them stretch.

1112
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,525
-Why do you keep looking at your watch?
-Christina,

1113
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,967
what would you do

1114
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,239
if you knew you had
less than a minute to live?

1115
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:30,046
I'd make those seconds count.

1116
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,185
I'd kiss you again.

1117
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:35,322
Again? Mmm.

1118
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,890
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!

1119
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:41,852
He's done enough, Doctor.

1120
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,251
And, I'm on the train...

1121
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,044
Everything's gonna be okay.

1122
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,927
It is a beautiful Monday
in Chicago today.

1123
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,158
Temperatures expected to
reach the lower 60s.

1124
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:27,599
Right now 55 at the lakefront, 54 at Midway,

1125
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,863
53 at O'Hare.

1126
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,564
And now, up in the sky, we've got...

1127
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,665
He earned that money.

1128
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:35,903
-Yeah, he did.
-He was funny.

1129
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:39,174
- Speaking of which, I have no cash.
- (LAUGHS) Great.

1130
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,546
Come here. I wanna show you something.

1131
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,877
- Such a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1132
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,046
It is a really perfect day.

1133
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,128
Do you believe in fate?

1134
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,962
Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.

1135
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,703
-Come here.
-Wow.

1136
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:26,756
So what do you wanna do today?

1137
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,927
I think we should stay here for a while.

1138
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,893
This feels like exactly where
we're supposed to be, doesn't it?

1139
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,870
Las Vegas' number one
morning news follows.

1140
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:46,675
It's 72 degrees
on a cloudy Monday morning.

1141
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:51,014
This is News Radio 840KX
in North Las Vegas.

1142
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,418
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.

1143
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,355
Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak.

1144
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,221
In her hand were five playing cards.

1145
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,526
At some point today,
you're gonna hear about

1146
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:12,403
a failed terrorist attack
on a commuter train near Chicago.

1147
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,276
You and I kept that bomb from going off.

1148
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:19,770
An attempted bombing on a CCR train
outside Chicago.

1149
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:23,882
But it was thwarted,
and the suspect was found on board,

1150
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,453
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.

1151
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,762
Captain Goodwin,
anything I can help you with?

1152
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,435
No, that's fine. I'll come back later.

1153
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,834
Keep an eye out.

1154
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:52,610
One of these days the right crisis

1155
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,773
is going to rear its head

1156
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:59,213
and source code is going to
have its moment in the sun.

1157
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:00,885
Yes, sir.

1158
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,229
If you're reading this e-mail,

1159
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:14,530
then source code works even better
than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.

1160
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:17,503
You thought you were creating
eight minutes of a past event,

1161
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,039
but you're not.

1162
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:22,099
You've created a whole new world.

1163
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:27,240
Goodwin, if I'm right,
somewhere at the source code facility

1164
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:31,081
you have a Captain Colter Stevens
waiting to send on a mission.

1165
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:35,179
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.

1166
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:38,388
Tell him everything is gonna be okay.
