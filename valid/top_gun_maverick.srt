178
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,134
North Island, sir?

179
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,970
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

180
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:41,910
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass
once and for all.

181
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,279
[scoffs]
It galls me to say it, but...

182
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:50,417
for reasons known
only to the Almighty
and your guardian angel...

183
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,955
you've been called back
to TOPGUN.

184
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,429
Sir?
You are dismissed,
Captain.

185
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,070
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

186
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,439
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

187
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,679
Maybe so, sir.

188
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,981
But not today.

189
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:29,082
[person] <i>Captain Pete</i>
<i>"Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

190
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,351
Your reputation precedes you.

191
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,621
Thank you, sir.

192
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,456
Wasn't a compliment.

193
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,127
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the Air Boss.

194
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,730
I believe
you know Admiral Bates.
Warlock, sir.

195
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:45,600
Must admit,
I wasn't expecting
an invitation back.

196
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,802
They're called orders,
Maverick.

197
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,404
You two have
something in common.

198
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,307
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

199
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,577
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

200
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,378
Just want to manage
expectations.

201
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,480
[sighs]

202
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,751
The target...

203
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,322
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

204
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,758
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

205
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:13,995
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

206
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,295
to our allies in the region.

207
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,898
The Pentagon
has tasked us

208
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,567
with assembling
a strike team
and taking it out

209
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:22,169
before it becomes
fully operational.

210
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:26,306
The plant sits
in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

211
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,942
Said valley is GPS-jammed

212
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,812
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

213
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,648
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

214
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,885
which in turn are backed up
by a plentiful reserve
of surplus aircraft.

215
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,021
Even a few old F-14s.

216
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,790
Seems like
we're not the only ones
holding on to old relics.

217
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,694
[Warlock]
What's your read, Captain?

218
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,899
Well, sir, normally
this would be a cakewalk
for the F-35's stealth,

219
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,334
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

220
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:58,405
And a surface-to-air threat
necessitates a low-level
laser-guided strike

221
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,008
tailor-made for the F-18.

222
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,576
I figure,

223
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,611
two precision bombs,
minimum.

224
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,648
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

225
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,850
That is one hell
of a steep climb
out of there,

226
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,653
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

227
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,655
You survive that,

228
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:16,057
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

229
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,493
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

230
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:22,195
Not in the same mission,
sir.

231
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,800
No.

232
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:30,938
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

233
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,372
Can it be done or not?

234
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,976
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

235
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,978
Three weeks. Maybe less.

236
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:40,915
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an F-18,
and...

237
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,251
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

238
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,453
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

239
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,523
I think you misunderstand,
Captain.

240
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:49,924
Sir?

241
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,893
We don't want you to fly it.

242
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,427
We want you to teach it.

243
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,565
Teach, sir?

244
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,335
We've recalled
12 TOPGUN graduates
from their squadrons.

245
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,872
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

246
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,675
They'll fly the mission.

247
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,778
Is there a problem, Captain?

248
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,949
You know there is, sir.

249
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:17,185
Yeah.

250
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,754
Bradley Bradshaw,
aka "Rooster."

251
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,956
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

252
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,958
What was his call sign?

253
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,160
"Goose," sir.

254
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,595
Tragic what happened.

255
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,496
Captain Mitchell
was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

256
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,431
Goose's death
was an accident.

257
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,201
[Cyclone]
Is that how you see it, Captain?

258
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,636
Is that how Goose's son
sees it?

259
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,341
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

260
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,944
You were a TOPGUN
instructor before.

261
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:45,546
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

262
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,014
It's not where
I belong.

263
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:49,016
Then let me be
perfectly blunt.

264
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,320
You were not my first choice.
In fact, you weren't
even on the list.

265
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,456
You are here at the request
of Admiral Kazansky.

266
00:20:56,591 --> 00:21:00,061
Now, Iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

267
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:03,631
and he seems to think
that you have something left
to offer the navy.

268
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,366
What that is,
I can't imagine.

take this job.

270

271
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,108
This will be your last post,
Captain.

272

ever again.

shipped off to the desert for

as long as I've known you.

Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

5,000 feet is not
just a rule. It is a law,
as immutable as gravity.

The hard deck
will be much lower

you were teaching, Captain?

That as good as they are,
sir, they still have
something to learn.

You are talking about
the best fighter pilots

their entire career,

been dropping bombs
from a high altitude

to no dogfighting.

call for something they
have never encountered.

Okay, you have less
than three weeks to teach them
how to fight as a team

the target.

684

And how to come home.

685
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,852
And how to come home, sir.

686
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,759
Every mission
has its risks.

687
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:47,628
These pilots accept that.

688
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,663
I don't, sir.

Every morning,

you will brief us on
your instructional plans
in writing.

691
00:43:57,572 --> 00:44:00,441
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

692
00:44:00,575 --> 00:44:04,145
Including the hard deck, sir?
Especially the hard deck,
Captain.

693
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,281
[Maverick] Sir.

694
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:09,250
What is this?

695
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,185
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

696
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,787
to practice
a low-level bombing run
per the mission parameters.

697
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:22,363
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, Captain.

698
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:24,198
[Hangman] <i>Yo, Coyote.</i>

699
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:26,200
Take a look at this.

700
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:32,607
[Coyote] The man, the legend.
There he is.

701
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,975
No, no, no.
Next to him.

702
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,978
He look familiar to you?

703
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,415
What have we here?

704
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:44,018
[Hangman] Bradshaw.

705
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,720
As I live and breathe.

706
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:49,490
[panting]

707
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:52,326
[Maverick]
Hey, Theo, you got big.

708
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,994
[child] Hey, Mav.

709
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:56,430
[soft rock playing over jukebox]

710
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:02,303
Amelia?

711
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:03,804
I know. I got big.

712
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:05,372
[chuckles] Yes.

713
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:07,576
Bar opens at 5:00.

714
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,444
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

715
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,012
[Amelia] Mom!

716
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,453
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

717
00:45:19,588 --> 00:45:21,121
Mom!

718
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:24,391
Mav says he owes you money.

719
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:27,795
Oh. Don't worry
about it.
I insist.

720
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:30,431
[sighs]

721
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:34,502
Thank you, Captain.
Consider your tab closed.

722
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,104
Captain? Still?

723
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:40,107
A highly decorated captain.

724
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:41,108
Finish up.

725
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,910
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

726
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:44,945
I can't go.
What do you mean,
you can't go?

727
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,282
Test tomorrow.
I have to study.
They only told us today.

728
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,518
Well, I can't
sail her alone.

729
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:51,919
Just use the engine.

730
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,321
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

731
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:56,056
[both] To fix the engine.

732
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,325
Mm-hmm.
I can help.

733
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:07,401
[Penny] Little rougher
than I was expecting.
You don't say.

734
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:11,338
Pull on the backstay.
We'll de-power the sails.

735
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:12,773
Okay.

736
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:14,808
What does that mean?

737
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:18,045
You're supposed to be
in the navy!

738
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:21,949
I don't sail boats, Penny.
I land on them.

739
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:25,386
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

740
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,087
So how do I do that?

741
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:29,823
[chuckles]
You pull on that
green line up there.

742
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,425
Green line.

743
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,195
Yep. Pull it hard.

744
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:38,399
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

745
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:40,401
tighten the jib.

746
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:43,437
Crank it.
You okay?
Yeah.

747
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:46,040
Good.

748
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:48,242
Now,

749
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:50,911
you ready?

750
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,415
For what?

751
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,216
The afterburner.

752
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:18,339
Now you're in the navy.

753
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,926
[engine turns off]

754
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,429
Thanks for
helping out today.

755
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,533
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

756
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:48,536
Hmm.

757
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,406
Don't give me that look.

758
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,742
What look?

759
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:55,610
That one.

760
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,280
Good night, Pete.

761
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,383
Night, Penny.

762
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,059
[exhales]

763
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:14,094
[chuckles]

764
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,564
[sighs]

765
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:19,701
[Amelia] Mom, is that you?

766
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,301
[Penny] Yeah, it's me.

767
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,772
I'll make you dinner.

768
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:25,139
[Amelia] Okay.

769
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,480
Time is your greatest enemy.

770
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,851
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

771
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,520
attacking in two-plane teams.

772
00:48:38,653 --> 00:48:41,355
You'll fly along
this narrow canyon
to your target.

773
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:44,958
Radar-guided
surface-to-air missiles
defend the area.

774
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:47,695
These SAMs, they're lethal.

775
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:51,666
But they were designed
to protect the skies above,
not the canyon below.

776
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,770
That's because the enemy
knows no one is insane enough
to try and fly below them.

777
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:59,440
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

778
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:03,944
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

779
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:05,412
You exceed this altitude...

780
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:07,948
[radar beeping]
...radar will spot you

781
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,451
and you're dead.
[beeping intensifies]

782
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:12,986
Your airspeed
will be 660 knots

783
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:14,556
minimum.

784
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:16,925
Time to target:
two and a half minutes.

785
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:22,029
That's because
fifth-generation fighters
wait at an air base nearby.

786
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:26,467
In a head-to-head
with these planes
in your F-18s, you're dead.

787
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:30,370
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

788
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:33,575
before these planes
even have a chance
of catching you.

789
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,811
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

790
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:42,282
<i>You'll fly a route</i>
<i>in your nav system</i>
<i>that simulates the canyon.</i>

791
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:44,284
<i>The faster you navigate</i>
<i>this canyon,</i>

792
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:46,987
<i>the harder it'll be</i>
<i>to stay under the radar</i>
<i>of these enemy SAMs.</i>

793
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,089
[grunting]
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

794
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:50,925
<i>the more intensely</i>
<i>the force of gravity</i>

795
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:52,993
<i>on your body multiplies...</i>
[grunts]

796
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:54,662
<i>...compressing your lungs...</i>
[exhales]

797
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:57,231
<i>...forcing the blood</i>
<i>from your brain...</i>
[grunting]

798
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:59,501
<i>...impairing your judgment</i>
<i>and reaction time.</i>

799
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:02,069
So for today's lesson,
we're gonna take it easy
on you.

800
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:05,439
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: three minutes.

801
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,510
Good luck.

802
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:16,483
[breathing heavily]

803
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,452
[Bob] Time to target
is one minute 30.

804
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:20,989
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

805
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:22,557
We got to move, Coyote.

806
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:24,893
Copy. Increasing speed.

807
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,293
Oh! [grunts]

808
00:50:27,461 --> 00:50:28,428
Oh, shit!

809
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:31,498
[beeping]

810
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:32,800
Why are they dead?

811
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:35,904
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a SAM took us out.

812
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,672
No. Why are they dead?

813
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:39,908
I slowed down and didn't
give her a warning.
It was my fault.

814
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,110
Was there a reason you didn't
communicate with your team?
I was focusing on--

815
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:45,914
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

816
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,247
None, sir.

817
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:49,517
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

818
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:51,218
You were briefed
on the terrain.

819
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:54,556
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

820
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:02,229
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

821
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:05,033
Negative, Payback.
Increase your speed.

822
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:10,237
You're going too fast, man.
No harm in being
ahead of schedule.

823
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:14,876
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

824
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:18,111
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

825
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,315
[radar beeping]

826
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:24,151
What happened?
[Hangman]
I flew as fast as I could.

827
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:26,086
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

828
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:29,824
And you put your team in danger,
and your wingman's dead.

829
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:32,627
They couldn't
keep up.

830
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:41,134
[Yale] <i>Rooster,</i>
<i>we're 20 seconds behind</i>
<i>and dropping.</i>

831
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:43,871
[Rooster]
We're fine. Speed is good.

832
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:45,640
Increase to 500 knots.

833
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:48,475
Negative, Yale.
Hold your speed.
[Yale] <i>Rooster, we're late!</i>

834
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:51,378
We're alive.
We'll make up time
in the straightaway.

835
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:52,914
[Yale] <i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

836
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:56,183
Just trust me.
Maintain your speed.
We can make it.

837
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:58,418
Why are you dead?

838
00:51:58,553 --> 00:52:00,054
You're team leader up there.

839
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:02,590
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

840
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:05,392
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

841
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,528
A minute late. [sighs]

842
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:10,130
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

843
00:52:10,263 --> 00:52:12,033
He is dead.
You don't know that.

844
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:15,737
You're not flying
fast enough. You don't
have a second to waste.

845
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,538
We made it to the target.

846
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:20,642
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

847
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:23,711
Then it's a dogfight.
Against
fifth-generation fighters.

848
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:26,446
[Rooster] Yeah.
We'd still have a chance.
[Maverick] In an F-18.

849
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:29,117
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

850
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,585
Exactly!

851
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,128
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

852
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,896
[Hangman]
You really don't get it.

853
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:45,900
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

854
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:47,935
or a man does not
come back.

855
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:50,337
No offense intended.

856
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:53,508
Yet somehow
you always manage.

857
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,443
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

858
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,412
You're conservative, that's all.
Lieutenant.

859
00:52:58,546 --> 00:53:03,450
We're going into combat, son,
on a level no living pilot's
ever seen.

860
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:06,186

01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:00,688
We'll see.

1035
01:07:00,822 --> 01:07:02,824
No. No, I mean it.

1036
01:07:02,957 --> 01:07:05,125
I'm never gonna
leave you again.

1037
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:08,328
Oh, shut up.

1038
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:10,598
Go on, get out of here.

1039
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,168
[grunts softly]

1040
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:26,213
Just don't
break her heart again.

1041
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:38,826
[Warlock] <i>Good morning.</i>

1042
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,061
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

1043
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:43,497
will be operational
earlier than expected.

1044
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:47,434
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

1045
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:50,505
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

1046
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:54,074
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley
with radiation.

1047
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:57,210
Sir, no one here
has successfully flown
a low-level course.

1048
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:59,514
Nevertheless,
you've been ordered
to move on.

1049
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:01,683
Captain.

1050
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,721
[Maverick] We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

1051
01:08:06,854 --> 01:08:08,723
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

1052
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:10,592
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

1053
01:08:10,725 --> 01:08:14,094
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

1054
01:08:15,063 --> 01:08:16,296
<i>Two pairs of F-18s will fly</i>

1055
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,899
<i>in a welded wing formation.</i>

1056
01:08:18,032 --> 01:08:21,803
<i>Teamwork. Precise coordination</i>
<i>of these aircraft is essential</i>

1057
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:24,639
<i>to both the mission's success</i>
<i>and your survival.</i>

1058
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:27,474
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

1059
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:32,547
On final approach,
you'll invert directly
into a steep dive.

1060
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,650
<i>This allows you to maintain</i>
<i>the lowest possible altitude</i>

1061
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:38,653
<i>and the only possible</i>
<i>attack angle.</i>

1062
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:46,961
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

1063
01:08:47,095 --> 01:08:49,097
<i>The two-seat aircraft</i>
<i>will paint the target</i>

1064
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:51,465
<i>with a laser bull's-eye.</i>
[beeping]

1065
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,433
The first pair
will breach the reactor

1066
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:57,237
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

1067
01:08:57,371 --> 01:09:00,273
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

1068
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:02,209
That's miracle number one.

1069
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:07,048
<i>The second team</i>
<i>will deliver the kill shot...</i>

1070
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,248
[target lock beeps]

1071
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:10,450
...and destroy the target.

1072
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:12,920
That's miracle number two.

1073
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:16,624
<i>If either team</i>
<i>misses the target...</i>

1074
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,995
That's a miss.
[Maverick]
<i>...the mission is a failure.</i>

1075
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:22,396
Damn it!

1076
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:24,999
[Maverick] Egress
is a steep high-G climb out

1077
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,801
to avoid hitting this mountain.

1078
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:32,272
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling
at least eight G's.

1079
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:33,741
Nine, minimum.

1080
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,577
The stress limit
of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

1081
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,245
[Maverick]
That's the accepted limit.

1082
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:40,447
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

1083
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:43,518
even if it means
bending your airframe.

1084
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:47,822
<i>You'll be pulling so hard,</i>
<i>you'll weigh close</i>
<i>to 2,000 pounds,</i>

1085
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:50,591
<i>your skull</i>
<i>crushing your spine...</i>
[grunting]

1086
01:09:50,725 --> 01:09:53,928
<i>...your lungs imploding</i>
<i>like an elephant's sitting</i>
<i>on your chest,</i>

1087
01:09:54,062 --> 01:09:57,732
<i>fighting with everything</i>
<i>you have just to keep</i>
<i>from blacking out.</i>

1088
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,534
[grunting, gasping]

1089
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,503
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

1090
01:10:03,236 --> 01:10:05,873
This is Coffin Corner.

1091
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:08,543
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

1092
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:12,479
you'll climb straight up
into enemy radar while losing
all of your airspeed.

1093
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:15,950
Within seconds,
you'll be fired upon
by enemy SAMs.

1094
01:10:17,118 --> 01:10:19,954
You've all faced
sustained G's before,
but this--

1095
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:23,958
this is gonna
take you and your aircraft
to the breaking point.

1096
01:10:24,092 --> 01:10:26,828
Sir, is this even achievable?

1097
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,830
The answer to that question

1098
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:31,498
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

1099
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:37,672
[sonic boom]

1100
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:43,044
Talk to me, Bob.
We are 12 seconds
late on target.

1101
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:46,080
We gotta move!
We gotta move!
Copy. Try to stay with me.

1102
01:10:46,214 --> 01:10:48,983

1103
01:10:49,117 --> 01:10:51,552
Huh? Wait, who's that?

1104
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:53,921
[Maverick] <i>Blue Team,</i>
<i>you've been spotted.</i>

1105
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:56,356
Shit, it's Maverick.
What the hell is he doing here?

1106
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,761
I'm a bandit on course
to intercept. Blue Team,
what are you gonna do?

1107
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:03,164
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

1108
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,899
Your call.
What do you want to do?

1109
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:07,735
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

1110
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:10,972
He's swinging around
to the north!
Stand by for pop-up.

1111
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:14,307
Be ready on that laser, Bob.
Copy. I'm on it.

1112
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:17,277
Blue Team,
bandit is still closing.

1113
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,478
Popping now.

[grunts]

1116
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,721
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

1117
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:29,322
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

1118
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:37,932
Target's in sight.
Where's my laser, Bob?

1119
01:11:38,065 --> 01:11:41,502
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1120
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:43,738
We're out of time.

[Maverick] That's tone.

1125
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:03,356
Maverick's got

Shit! We're dead.

1126
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,526

1127
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,861

01:17:00,688 --> 01:17:03,124
I appreciate that, sir,
but there is no time.
The mission--

1199
01:17:03,257 --> 01:17:05,759
I'll be taking over
the training from here.

1200
01:17:06,528 --> 01:17:07,728
Sir?

1201
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:10,431
We both know you didn't
want this job, Captain.

1202
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:12,967
Sir, they're not ready.
It was your job
to get them ready.

1203
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,403
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1204
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:19,773
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1205
01:17:20,575 --> 01:17:22,611
Sir--
You're grounded, Captain.

1206
01:17:22,743 --> 01:17:24,378
Permanently.

1207
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:29,884
Sir--
That is all.

1208
01:17:48,102 --> 01:17:49,136
I heard.

1209
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:52,706
I'm sorry.

1210
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,142
What are you gonna do?

1211
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:57,711
Ice is gone.

1212
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:01,916
What choice do I have?

1213
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:05,452
You'll have to
find a way back
on your own.

1214
01:18:05,587 --> 01:18:07,021
No, Penny.

1215
01:18:08,623 --> 01:18:10,124
I'm out.

1216
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:13,127
This is over.

1217
01:18:13,562 --> 01:18:14,596
Pete.

1218
01:18:14,728 --> 01:18:17,097
If you lost
your wingman up there,

1219
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:19,466
you'd keep fighting.

1220
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:21,035
You wouldn't just give up.

1221
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,871
Those are your pilots.

1222
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:27,676
If anything
happens to them,

1223
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:30,144
you'll never
forgive yourself.

1224
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:36,083
I don't know what to do.

1225
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:41,755
But you'll find a way.

1226
01:18:43,857 --> 01:18:45,259
I know you will.

1227
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:49,396
[Cyclone] <i>Captain Mitchell</i>
<i>is no longer your instructor.</i>

1228
01:18:49,531 --> 01:18:52,733
And as of today,
there are new
mission parameters.

1229
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:55,236
Time to target
is now four minutes.
[beeps]

1230
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:57,938
You'll be entering
the valley level
at reduced speed.

1231
01:18:58,072 --> 01:19:00,774
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1232
01:19:00,908 --> 01:19:03,612
Sir, won't we be
giving their planes
time to intercept?

1233
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:06,347
Well, Lieutenant,
you have a fighting chance
against enemy aircraft.

1234
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,483
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision
with a mountain?

1235
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:12,353
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1236
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:13,821
level with the north wall.

1237
01:19:13,954 --> 01:19:16,056
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1238
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:18,058
but you will avoid
the high-G climb out.

1239
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:20,794
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1240
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:24,064
[monitor beeping]

1241
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,301
Who the hell is that?

1242
01:19:28,737 --> 01:19:31,740
[Maverick]
<i>Maverick to Range Control.</i>
<i>Entering Point Alpha.</i>

1243
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:33,807
Confirm green range.

1244
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:38,078
[Range Control]
<i>Uh, Maverick, Range Control,</i>
<i>uh, green range is confirmed.</i>

1245
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:41,448
<i>I don't see an event scheduled</i>
<i>for you, sir.</i>

1246
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,551
[Maverick]
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1247
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:44,818
Nice.

1248
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,721
<i>Setting time to target:</i>

1249
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:48,657
<i>Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

1250
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:50,324
2:15? That's impossible.

1251
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:53,327
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

1252
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:05,139

1253
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:10,844

[grunting]

1258
01:21:30,859 --> 01:21:34,261
Popping in three, two, one.

1259

[target lock beeps]

1260
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:01,856
Bombs away.

1261

1262
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:14,034

01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,142
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!
[cheers]

1265
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:24,378
[Bob] Yes.

1266
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:28,081
Damn.

1267
01:22:28,215 --> 01:22:30,718
[breathing heavily]

1268
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:43,731
[Cyclone] You have put me
in a difficult position,
Captain.

1269
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:47,602
On the one hand,
you have demonstrated that
this mission can be flown.

1270
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:50,404
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1271
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:52,907
On the other hand,

1272
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,844
you did it by stealing
a multimillion-dollar
military aircraft

1273
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:59,313
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never
be airworthy again.

1274
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:03,383
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1275
01:23:03,518 --> 01:23:06,153
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1276
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:08,322
and dishonorably discharged.

1277
01:23:08,923 --> 01:23:10,457
So what do I do?

1278
01:23:11,258 --> 01:23:12,392
Risk the lives of my pilots

1279
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:14,562
and perhaps the success
of this mission

1280
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,164
or...

1281
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:20,167
risk my career

1282
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:23,036
by appointing you team leader?

1283
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:31,078
Sir--
I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, Captain.

1284
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:57,605
[ringing]
[all cheering]

1285
01:24:13,988 --> 01:24:15,623
[no audible dialogue]

1286
01:25:11,746 --> 01:25:13,447
Talk to me, Goose.

1287
01:25:16,483 --> 01:25:18,318
[Warlock] Captain Mitchell!

1288
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:26,828
You're where you belong.

1289
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:33,367
Make us proud.

1290
01:25:59,226 --> 01:26:01,562
It has been an honor
flying with you.

1291
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:06,466
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1292
01:26:06,601 --> 01:26:09,904
This is a very specific mission.

1293
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:13,407
My choice
is a reflection of that
and nothing more.

1294
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:15,643
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1295
01:26:17,078 --> 01:26:18,813
Payback and Fanboy.

1296
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:21,348
Phoenix and Bob.

1297
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:27,354
[Cyclone] And your wingman.

1298
01:26:31,626 --> 01:26:32,660
Rooster.

1299
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:39,232
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1300
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:42,503
for any reserve role
that's required.

1301
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:44,539
Dismissed.

1302
01:26:51,946 --> 01:26:55,049
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

1303
01:26:56,349 --> 01:27:00,220
<i>A secret uranium</i>
<i>enrichment site</i>
<i>under rogue state control.</i>

1304
01:27:00,353 --> 01:27:02,222
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

1305
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:04,424
tucked between
these two mountains.

1306
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,329
<i>Your route of ingress</i>
<i>is heavily defended</i>
<i>by surface-to-air missiles</i>

1307
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:11,799
<i>backed up</i>
<i>by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

1308
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:14,669
Once your F-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1309
01:27:14,802 --> 01:27:16,738
Tomahawk missiles
from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

1310
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:20,775
will launch
a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

1311
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:24,377
<i>This will knock out</i>
<i>their runway.</i>

1312
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:29,050
<i>But you'll have to contend with</i>
<i>any planes already in the air.</i>

1313
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:32,486
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know
you're coming.

1314
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,622
Your time to target

1315
01:27:34,756 --> 01:27:37,692
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1316
01:27:38,993 --> 01:27:40,928
<i>Any longer than that,</i>
<i>and you will be exposed</i>

1317
01:27:41,062 --> 01:27:43,998
<i>to any aircraft</i>
<i>the Tomahawks may have missed.</i>

1318
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:49,837
This is what you've all
been training for.

1319
01:27:51,572 --> 01:27:53,406
Come home safely.

I...

1326
01:28:30,778 --> 01:28:32,713
I just want to say--
[loud radio chatter]

1327
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:43,057
We'll talk

1328

when we get back.

1329
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:53,868
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

01:28:54,936 --> 01:28:55,970
Hey.

1331
01:28:59,339 --> 01:29:00,908

Hey, you with me?

1335
01:29:18,659 --> 01:29:20,761
I don't like that look, Mav.

Looks like we're clear
on radar, Mav.

1378
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,135
Let's not take it for granted.

1379

They don't know we're here.

The second those Tomahawks
hit the air base,

1391
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:08,048
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1392
01:34:08,182 --> 01:34:11,085
We have to get there
before they do.
Increase speed.

Come on, Rooster.
Move it or lose it.

Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

1411
01:35:21,488 --> 01:35:23,357
If we don't increase our speed
right now,

1412
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:26,460
those bandits
are gonna be waiting for us
when we reach the target.

That's the whole point.

1539
01:43:57,905 --> 01:43:59,874
What the hell
were you even thinking?

1540
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:02,309
You told me not to think!

1541
01:44:08,816 --> 01:44:11,251
[both panting]

1542
01:44:18,826 --> 01:44:19,927
Well,

1543
01:44:21,361 --> 01:44:22,697
it's good to see you.

1544
01:44:25,166 --> 01:44:26,768
It's good to see you too.

1545
01:44:30,538 --> 01:44:32,339
So what's the plan?

1546
01:44:35,176 --> 01:44:39,647
[alarm blaring]

1547
01:44:43,217 --> 01:44:44,619
You're not serious.

1548
01:44:48,856 --> 01:44:51,458
[alarm continues]

1549
01:44:59,634 --> 01:45:01,736
[Rooster]
You've got to be
shitting me.

1550
01:45:03,704 --> 01:45:05,173
An F-14?

1551
01:45:05,305 --> 01:45:06,874
I shot down three MiGs
in one of those.

1552
01:45:07,008 --> 01:45:09,777
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1553
01:45:12,312 --> 01:45:14,515
Let's find out.
Mav!

1554
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:17,417
Okay.

1555
01:45:24,491 --> 01:45:26,493
[alarm continues]
[indistinct shouting]

1556
01:45:26,627 --> 01:45:29,730
There's guys up there, Mav.
Yeah.

1557
01:45:29,864 --> 01:45:32,834
[Rooster]
There's more over there.
[Maverick] Okay.

1558
01:45:32,967 --> 01:45:35,570
[Maverick] Let's start running.
[Rooster] Yeah, run. Run.

1559
01:45:44,712 --> 01:45:47,648
Once-- Once I give you
the signal for air,

1560
01:45:47,782 --> 01:45:50,417
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1561
01:45:50,551 --> 01:45:51,919
When the engine starts,

1562
01:45:52,053 --> 01:45:54,354
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1563
01:45:54,487 --> 01:45:56,157
You understand?
Yeah.

1564
01:45:56,290 --> 01:45:58,226
[powers up]

1565
01:45:58,358 --> 01:45:59,594
Yes!

1566
01:46:01,262 --> 01:46:03,631
Once I'm up,
stow the ladder.

1567
01:46:11,339 --> 01:46:13,608
Okay. Wow.

1568
01:46:14,508 --> 01:46:16,611
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?

1569
01:46:18,512 --> 01:46:20,615
[electronics beeping, whirring]

1570
01:46:29,290 --> 01:46:31,458
[beeping]

1571
01:46:45,072 --> 01:46:48,475
Oh, my God.
This thing is so old.

1572
01:46:49,243 --> 01:46:50,477
All right.

1573
01:46:55,316 --> 01:46:56,984
Canopy?
Clear.

1574
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:17,470
Both runways are cratered.

1575
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:19,907
How we gonna get
this museum piece
in the air?

1576
01:47:29,984 --> 01:47:31,752
Why are the wings
coming out, Mav?

1577
01:47:38,059 --> 01:47:40,761
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

1578
01:47:40,895 --> 01:47:44,365
This is a very short
taxiway, Mav.

1579
01:47:44,497 --> 01:47:45,900
Just hang on.

1580
01:47:47,134 --> 01:47:48,669
Holy shit!

1581
01:47:54,474 --> 01:47:55,643
Come on, come on, come on.

1582
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,712
Needle's alive. Come on.

1583
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:02,482
Mav?
That's it. Come on, come on!

1584
01:48:02,616 --> 01:48:03,884
All right.

1585
01:48:04,585 --> 01:48:06,821
Mav!
Here we go.

1586
01:48:08,155 --> 01:48:09,724
Holy shit.

1587
01:48:23,104 --> 01:48:26,307
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from Rooster's ESAT.

1588
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,309
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

1589
01:48:28,442 --> 01:48:29,944
Have you lost him?
No, sir.

1590
01:48:30,845 --> 01:48:32,279
He's supersonic.

1591
01:48:32,813 --> 01:48:34,081
He's airborne.

1592
01:48:35,249 --> 01:48:37,151
In what?
Sir.

1593
01:48:37,284 --> 01:48:41,889
Overwatch reports
an F-14 Tomcat is airborne
and on course for our position.

1594
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:45,292
Can't be. It can't be!

1595
01:48:47,028 --> 01:48:48,062
Maverick.

1596
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:52,433
Okay, Rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1597
01:48:52,566 --> 01:48:54,035
I'm working on it.

1598
01:48:54,168 --> 01:48:57,271
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1599
01:48:57,405 --> 01:49:00,509
What do I do?
Talk me through it.
Okay, first the radio.

1600
01:49:00,641 --> 01:49:02,511
Throw the, uh--

1601
01:49:02,643 --> 01:49:05,813
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

1602
01:49:05,946 --> 01:49:08,849
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1603
01:49:08,983 --> 01:49:11,085
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1604
01:49:11,218 --> 01:49:12,820
I'll figure it out.

1605
01:49:15,856 --> 01:49:18,225
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1606
01:49:23,464 --> 01:49:24,799
What do we do?

1607
01:49:25,466 --> 01:49:27,334
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1608
01:49:27,468 --> 01:49:30,137
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1609
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:33,641
Well, here they come.

1610
01:49:33,774 --> 01:49:37,078
What's your plan?
Just put your mask on.

1611
01:49:38,045 --> 01:49:40,748
Remember,
we're on the same team.

1612
01:49:43,284 --> 01:49:45,152
Just wave and smile.

1613
01:49:45,753 --> 01:49:47,354
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1614
01:49:54,228 --> 01:49:55,996
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

1615
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:59,600
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1616
01:49:59,733 --> 01:50:03,671
[Rooster]
What about that one? Any idea?
No, never seen that one either.

1617
01:50:06,508 --> 01:50:10,778
Oh, shit. His wingman is moving
into weapons envelope.

1618
01:50:11,412 --> 01:50:12,913
All right, listen up.

1619
01:50:13,047 --> 01:50:15,616
When I tell you,
you grab those rings
above your head.

1620
01:50:15,749 --> 01:50:17,418
That's the ejection handle.

1621
01:50:18,352 --> 01:50:20,821
[Rooster]
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

1622
01:50:21,556 --> 01:50:23,691
Not their missiles and guns.

1623
01:50:27,928 --> 01:50:29,864
Then it's a dogfight.

1624
01:50:29,997 --> 01:50:33,100
An F-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

1625
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:36,904
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

1626
01:50:38,139 --> 01:50:40,307
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

1627
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:42,810
But you are here.

1628
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:44,912
Come on, Mav.

1629
01:50:45,813 --> 01:50:47,181
Don't think.

1630
01:50:48,349 --> 01:50:49,416
Just do.

1631
01:50:54,755 --> 01:50:56,390
[grunts]

1632
01:51:04,899 --> 01:51:07,101
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

1633
01:51:07,835 --> 01:51:09,870
[target lock beeps]

1634
01:51:11,172 --> 01:51:13,674
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air!
Hang on.

1635
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:18,946
Yeah, Mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

1636
01:51:21,415 --> 01:51:23,050
[target lock beeps]

1637
01:51:23,984 --> 01:51:26,053
Here comes another one.
[grunts]

1638
01:51:28,557 --> 01:51:30,824
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

1639
01:51:33,928 --> 01:51:35,362
Splitting the throttles.

1640
01:51:37,464 --> 01:51:38,799
Coming around.

1641
01:51:42,836 --> 01:51:44,438
Give me tone, give me tone.
[target lock beeps]

1642
01:51:44,573 --> 01:51:47,174
You got him, Mav!
You got him!
Taking the shot.

1643
01:51:53,147 --> 01:51:54,381
What the--

1644
01:51:55,149 --> 01:51:57,484
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

1645
01:51:58,786 --> 01:52:00,921
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1646
01:52:01,055 --> 01:52:03,724
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1647
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:06,760
Here he comes!

1648
01:52:10,464 --> 01:52:12,433
[beeping]

1649
01:52:14,768 --> 01:52:16,070
[grunts]

1650
01:52:19,173 --> 01:52:21,041
Talk to me, Rooster.
Where is he?

1651
01:52:21,175 --> 01:52:23,143
[Rooster] He's still on us!

1652
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:32,353
We took a hit! We took a hit!
Damn it!

1653
01:52:37,191 --> 01:52:39,661
Come on, Mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.
Brace yourself.

1654
01:52:39,793 --> 01:52:41,295
[grunts]

1655
01:52:44,164 --> 01:52:45,132
[groans]

1656
01:52:50,304 --> 01:52:51,372
Holy shit.

1657
01:52:58,178 --> 01:53:00,281
[target lock beeping]
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1658
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:06,053
Damn it!

1659
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:09,823
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

1660
01:53:15,496 --> 01:53:16,830
Come on, Mav, come on.

1661
01:53:19,133 --> 01:53:21,068
You got him, Mav!
It's not over yet.

1662
01:53:25,406 --> 01:53:27,509
One last chance.
You can do this.

1663
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:30,512
[Maverick] Come on, Maverick.

1664
01:53:33,881 --> 01:53:36,417
[alarm blaring]

1665
01:53:39,853 --> 01:53:42,022
Yes! Splash two!

1666
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:45,826
[breathes heavily]

1667
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:52,701
[beeping]

1668
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:54,502
Mav, I got the radio on.
Outstanding.

1669
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:56,705
Get us in touch
with the boat.
Copy that.

1670
01:53:56,837 --> 01:53:58,839
[alarm blaring]

1671
01:53:58,972 --> 01:54:00,374
Oh, my God.

1672
01:54:02,142 --> 01:54:04,111
Where the hell is this guy?

1673
01:54:05,145 --> 01:54:07,047
He's on our nose.

1674
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:11,553
[clicking]
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1675
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,123
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

1676
01:54:18,526 --> 01:54:19,993
That was close.

1677
01:54:22,129 --> 01:54:24,298
We're out of flares, Mav.

1678
01:54:28,235 --> 01:54:30,437
Shit, he's already on us.

1679
01:54:34,676 --> 01:54:37,077
[groans] This is not good.

1680
01:54:38,847 --> 01:54:41,281
[grunts, panting]

1681
01:54:44,985 --> 01:54:47,187
We took another hit!
No, no, no, no, no!

1682
01:54:51,793 --> 01:54:53,961
We can't take much more of this.

1683
01:54:54,094 --> 01:54:55,830
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1684
01:54:55,963 --> 01:54:57,231
What?
We need altitude.

1685
01:54:57,364 --> 01:54:59,366
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1686
01:54:59,501 --> 01:55:01,669
Mav, wait!
Rooster,
there's no other way.

1687
01:55:04,839 --> 01:55:06,240
Eject, eject, eject!

1688
01:55:06,373 --> 01:55:09,143
[grunting]
Rooster, pull the handle!
Eject!

1689
01:55:09,276 --> 01:55:11,178
It's not working!

1690
01:55:17,918 --> 01:55:20,889
[beeping]

1691
01:55:21,021 --> 01:55:24,258
Mav! [breathing heavily]

1692
01:55:25,225 --> 01:55:26,927
[whispers] I'm sorry.

1693
01:55:28,095 --> 01:55:29,930
I'm sorry, Goose.

1694
01:55:32,734 --> 01:55:34,301
[target lock beeps]

1695
01:55:42,276 --> 01:55:44,077
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1696
01:55:44,211 --> 01:55:46,213
This is your savior speaking.

1697
01:55:46,346 --> 01:55:48,148
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

1698
01:55:48,282 --> 01:55:50,819
<i>return your tray tables</i>
<i>to their locked</i>
<i>and upright positions...</i>

1699
01:55:50,951 --> 01:55:51,920
[laughs]

1700
01:55:52,052 --> 01:55:54,488
<i>...and prepare for landing.</i>

1701
01:55:56,724 --> 01:55:58,860
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1702
01:55:58,992 --> 01:56:02,496
I am good, Rooster.
I'm very good.

1703
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:06,166
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

1704
01:56:07,569 --> 01:56:09,704
[breathing heavily]

1705
01:56:27,655 --> 01:56:30,257
Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

1706
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:32,594
No tailhook.
Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1707
01:56:32,727 --> 01:56:35,229
Foul deck! Foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

1708
01:56:36,063 --> 01:56:37,599
Go!

1709
01:56:59,787 --> 01:57:02,022
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

1710
01:57:02,155 --> 01:57:05,092
All right,
I won't tell you that.
Okay.

[panting]

1712
01:57:29,017 --> 01:57:30,083
You good?

1713
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:32,185
Yeah. I'm good.

[cheering]

1715
01:58:17,497 --> 01:58:20,334
Chalked yourself
another kill.
That makes two.

1716
01:58:20,902 --> 01:58:22,102
Mav has five.

1717
01:58:22,235 --> 01:58:23,771
Makes him an ace.

1718
01:58:41,723 --> 01:58:44,291
Captain Mitchell!
Captain Mitchell!

1719
01:58:50,932 --> 01:58:52,366
Sir.

1720
01:58:59,607 --> 01:59:01,542
Thank you for saving my life.

1721
01:59:02,644 --> 01:59:04,779
It's what my dad
would've done.

1722
01:59:43,951 --> 01:59:45,185
Hey, Mav.

1723
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:47,320
Jimmy.

1724
01:59:48,255 --> 01:59:49,489
Is, uh--

1725
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:51,526
Is Penny around?

1726
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:55,295
Uh, she took Amelia
on a sailing trip.

1727
01:59:57,532 --> 01:59:59,667
Did she say
when she'd be back?

1728
01:59:59,801 --> 02:00:01,636
[Jimmy]
You know, she didn't.

1729
02:00:03,871 --> 02:00:05,640
Can I get you anything?

1730
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:19,921
Get in there.
