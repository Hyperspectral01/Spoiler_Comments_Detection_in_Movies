1
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,255
Their astronaut is going to die.

2
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:15,134
Of course there are other ways...

3
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:20,014
...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

4
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:23,017
and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit.

5
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:25,520
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

6
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:27,021
They don't know.

7
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:29,983
Our booster technology is classified.

8
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:35,530
So if we do nothing...

9
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:40,201
The world would never know we could have helped.

10
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:46,124
Then, for the sake of argument, let's say we
decide to help them...

11
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:50,712
We'd be giving up a booster and effectively
cancelling Taiyang Shen.

12
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:56,884
We need to keep this among scientists,
a co-operation between space agencies.
