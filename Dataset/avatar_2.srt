00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,586
The woods of Pandora

2
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,838
they hide many dangers.

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,139
But the most dangerous thing about Pandora is...

4
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,937
that you may love her too much.

5
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,744
We sing songs to remember.

6
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,081
Each bead, a story in our life.

7
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,669
Pearl for the birth of our son.

8
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,843
I don't care!
- I don't care!

9
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,937
Pearl when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.

10
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,106
Born by Grace's avatar.

11
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,985
The daughter whose conception is
was a complete mystery.

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,252
Pearl for the first union with Eve.

13
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,842
People say, we live in Avey,

14
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,137
and Eva lives in us.

15
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,310
The great mother carries everything
your children in your heart.

16
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,446
Happiness is simple.

17
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,993
But who would have thought it would
a marine like me hack it?

18
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:28,500
When I met your father,
I tried to kill him.

19
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,919
It was love at first sight.

20
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,921
In an hour, we had four.

21
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,052
When we sent the Heavenly People
back to earth

22
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,054
a few of them remained.

23
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,433
Scientists, loyal to the Na'vi.

24
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,727
And then there was Spider.

25
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,730
He's stuck here.
Too young for a cryo-capsule.

26
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,357
You little beast.
- See you, Norm!

27
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,818
war orphan,
which were raised by people from the laboratory.

28
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,154
Spider, get a spare!
- I'm only going to the village!

29
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,469
He was not part of our family.

30
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,242
He was like a stray cat.

31
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,119
Always there somewhere.

32
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,663
Inseparable from our children.

33
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,670
For Neytiri,
he will always be a stranger.

34
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,339
One of them.

35
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,925
He belongs with his kind.

36
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,640
He's mine!
I took it first.

37
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,726
Why should I leave it to you? -He's mine!
- It took me several years

38
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,268
let my tongue enter my head.

39
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,204
Lo'ak, liar! Give it to me!
- But now that I hear him,

40
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,857
it comes to me like native.
-I hate you!

41
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,695
I hate you endlessly, Lo'ak!
Penisolics!

42
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,616
Enough! Don't let me come there.

43
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,369
He'll come out from behind those big rocks.

44
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,747
There it is.

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,799
There. Go get her!

46
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,920
Netejam, the mighty fisherman.

47
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,005
There. Well done.

48
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,345
It's big.
- At the stones.

49
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,931
Where you said.

50
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,351
How tall is he?
- He's this tall. -He's tall!

51
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,903
Time flies.

52
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,813
Like a dream.

53
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,433
Kiri.
-Brother, come on.

54
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,276
Come on.

55
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,036
Smile, you idiot.

56
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,321
Happiness is simple.

57
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,776
Like a night out.

58
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:27,287
Time without children.

59
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,944
But the problem with luck...

60
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,115
It can disappear in a split second.

61
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,373
A new star in the night.

62
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,835
That can only mean one thing.

63
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,761
Ships. They slow down.

64
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,022
And the Skymen are coming back.

Pulse 168.

68
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,842
Here it is.

69
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,425
You are fine.

70
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,936
Just lie still.

71
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,452
Keep calm.

72
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,766
Yes. Pupillary reaction is good.

73
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,443
Get it out of his face.

74
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,320
Colonel...

75
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,272
can you hear me
Colonel?

76
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,776
You must lie down, sir.

77
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,576
Sedate him!
-Get out of here.

78
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,619
Go Go!
- Call security!

79
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,171
Catch him!
- Catch him!

80
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,707
Hold it!
-Calm down!

81
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,334

Isn't this horrible?

90
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:45,103
Get ready. Two minutes until landing
on Pandora. Safe for Delta V.

91
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,065
OK. Umbilical cord removed.

92

you are Colonel Miles Quaritch.

Only younger, taller, bluer...

95
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,369
And not nearly as gorgeous.

96
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm going on a mission in two hours

The heads thought it was smart
to make a copy of this just in case.

99

Parker, what should I say now?

101
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,557

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,774
We're going to send this back to Earth
where are you growing in the lab right now.

105
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,526
We're going to transfer this to you, and then...

106
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,862
Do I do this or do you?
- Hurry up.

107
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:41,785
Anyway, the idea is to switch
awareness of the most experienced operatives...

108
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,580
As Corporal Wainfleet is there,

109
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:49,418
and your humble narrator,
into recombinant bodies.

110
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:54,298
You're recombinant now, Colonel,
filled with my memories and charm.

111
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,677
You will not remember my death,
because it hasn't happened yet,

112
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,437
and won't.

113
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,189
That's right.
-You bet.

114
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,891
Whatever happened,

115
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,519
if you are even a little clone of me,
you will crave revenge.

116
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,439
And Jake Sully will be at the top of that list.

117
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,577
Remember, boy...

118
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,404
A Marine cannot be defeated.

119
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,658
They can kill us,
but we will regroup in hell.

120
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,586
Always loyal.

121
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,491
Ground team, move!

122
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,830
Take this! Go!

123
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,003
Here we go. Two minutes, people.
Here we go.

124
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:04,178
Bro, we gotta get down there.
-By no means! Dad will skin us!

125
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,146
Come on.
Don't be lukewarm.

126
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,724
Lo'ak!
Come back here, you...

127
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,898
We're taking the whole crate! We take frames
for bullets, rocket launchers, stingers.

128
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,994
Brother, let's go. Come on!
- Lo'ak!

129
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,438
Okay, let's go!

130
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,946
Lo'ak!

131
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,457
Move! Take it!

132
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,492
Take this weapon!
Boy, go!

133
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,545
Lo'ak!

134
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,747
You don't even know how to use it.

135
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,249
My dad taught me.

136
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,459
A fighter jet is coming!

137
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,970
Retreat!

138
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,643
Brother, come on!

139
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,396
Lo'ak, where are you?

140
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:04,907
We don't care!

141
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,041
Easy easy.
Are you OK?

142
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,792
Yes.
-Where's your brother?

143
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,669
There.
-Where is he? Where?

144
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,184
Get out of here! Go!

145
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,798
We don't care!

146
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,585
Oh no.

147
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,421
No no.

148
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,216
God.

149
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,806
Dad?

150
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,726
What are you doing here, boy?
Where was your mind?

151
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,688
I'm sorry.

152
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,074
I'm very sorry, sir.

153
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,737
You're not in Kansas anymore.

154
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,449
Let's go to Pandora.

155
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:55,205
I know that everyone to themselves
you are asking the same question.

156
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,510
Why so blue?

157
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,549
Because of the sins of our past life,

158
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,177
we are resurrected in form
our enemy.

159
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,598
This gives us their size,
strength, speed.

160
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,017
And with our training...

161
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,227
It's a pretty potent mix.

162
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,315
Did we get the assignment yet?
-You bet.

163
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,443
Our task is to find and kill

164
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,446
the leader of the Na'vi rebels.

165
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,824
The one they call Toruk Makto.

166
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,285
Jake Sully.
-That!

167
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,670
Attack, attack!

168
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,547
You're mine!

169
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,299
Knock! Come on!

170
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,053
I'm definitely faster when I'm blue.
-You idiot. -Not seriously.

171
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,264
And animals respect me more.
They don't see me as a man.

172
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,266
Stop. You are a man?

173
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,120
They're coming!

174
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,281
HIGH CAMP, OMATIKAY STREET

175
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,576
They're coming!
Run, Spider!

176
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,912
The warband is back!

177
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,665
Come on.
-Here we go. Come on.

178
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,349
Mum! - Tuk...
-Mum. - Knock, Knock.

179
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,028
Choir!

180
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,606
You should be scouts.

181
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,142
Notice the enemies,
and report.

182
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:47,653
From afar!

183
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,028
Does any of this sound familiar?
Come here!

184
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,489
Jesus. I'll give it to you two
geniuses to complete the task,

185
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,083
and you disobey a direct order.

186
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,703
Kiri, can you help grandma
around the wounded? Please?

187
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,540
My brother is wounded. -It's fine.
- Tuk, go with her. Come on. -Dad.

188
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,377
Sir. I take full responsibility.
- Yes, you take over. That's right.

189
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,380
Because you are the older brother.
You have to act accordingly.

190
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,049
MaJake.

191
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:15,095
Your son is really bleeding.
- Mother, it's okay. I...

192
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,724
Go get it patched.
Come on, willingly.

193
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,107
You realize it's because of you
your brother almost died.

194
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,118
Yes sir.

195
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,988
You are punished.
You are banned from flying for a month.

196
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,200
Take care of the spawn.
For all of them. -Yes sir.

197
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,793
And get that shit off your face.

198
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,922
You want a kiss on the scratch?
- Give him this. -Okay.

199
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:54,593
I would use yala bark.
- Here, drink. -Really? And who is Tsahik?

200
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,979
You are...
Move.

201
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,890
you are, grandma,
but the bark is better.

202
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,569
It burns less.

203
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,612
A mighty warrior.

204
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,538
What is it?

205
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,535
Netejam and Lo'ak look up to you.

206
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,454
It was hard for them.

207
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,132
I know.

208
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,794
You are very strict with them.

209
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,007
I am their father.
That's my job.

210
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,262
This is not a unit.
This is family.

211
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,608
I thought we were out of them.

212
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,578
Hey buddy.
How's it going? - Spiders.

213
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,838
Your face is mine.

214
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,382
I'm here.

215
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,375
Only for avatars.
Go around!

216
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,293
Sorry.

217
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,754
Yes. Those blue stripes
they don't make you bigger bro.

218
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,882
Yes, I can still beat you up.

219
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,429
What a day.
- Long.

220
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,518
Really hilarious, folks.
But you know what's really horrible?

221
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:28,312
You can breathe
earth air for hours,

222
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,023
and I can inhale yours
air for ten seconds.

223
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,317
Yes, Monkey, that's really awful.

224
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,244
For you.

225
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,194
Bye, Max.
- Hi, kids.

226
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:44,654
Bye. What's up, Max?

227
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:46,165
What's up, Norm?

228
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,003
Hi Mom.

229
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:07,142
Maybe I'm just going crazy here
but I see actual proof

230
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:11,522
systematic response
on a global level.

231
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,532
Can not...

232
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,069
I will not use the term "intelligence."
It is...

233
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,531
Perhaps "awareness" is a better word.

2 3 4
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:26,537
It's like she's whole
biosphere Pandora conscious

235
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,207
and capable of such
cognitive reaction.

236
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,211
Shit, I can't say that.

237
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,929
He will crucify me.

238
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,547
I must say...

239
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:40,474
Who do you think pumped her up?

240
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:44,471
I'm pretty sure it was Norm.
-100%.

241
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,474
You two don't deserve to live.
-No no. Think about that.

242
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,477
He is the teacher's pet.
He is always with her in the laboratory.

243
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,481
I would kill myself.
I would drink acid.

244
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:59,486
Bro, you are right. He is on everyone
recording. Brother, look how he's looking at her.

245
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,075
I mean, their two avatars
they were in the forest alone...

246
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,417
Bullshit!
- People.

247
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,497
Sometimes it's not so great
know who your father is.

248
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,463
No preference. I don't even remember him.

249
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,465
No, Spider.
- Mate.

250
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,510
Spiders...

251
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:26,513
You are not him.

252
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,482
BRIDGEHEAD CITY

253
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,472
Go!
Straight to the terminal.

254
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,517
Don't stop you!

255
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,480
Take off the masks.

256
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:23,487
Sir, this is the general.

257
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,006
General Ardmore.

258
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,460
I'm glad, Colonel.
I've heard good things,

259
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:41,213
but a lot has changed
since your last service here.

260
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:42,758
Take a walk with me.

261
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,471
The new operations center is here.
It just worked.

262
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:53,475
These editors can
build a building in 6 days.

263
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:58,438
We have done more in a year
than for the previous 30.

264
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,691
We're not here to run a mine, Colonel.

265
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,528
As a planetary commander
I have a more important mission.

266
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,458
The earth is dying.

267
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,462
Our task is
to subdue this wilderness.

268
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:20,502
The goal is to make Pandora
a new home for humanity.

269
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:26,508
But before we can do that,
we must pacify the enemies.

270
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,472
Sali's attacks
they become bolder and more frequent.

271
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,398
His attacks are well planned.

272
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,352
It has good coordination between
of its ground and air troops.

273
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,112
His troops
they attack our remote places.

274
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:43,400
Mines, pipelines,
cutting our supply chain.

275
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:47,487
They attacked the maglev two days ago.

276
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:56,497
Some information about Sally's operative
base? -Yes. Show me the mountains.

277
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:00,501
It is a cave system
in the Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

278
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:06,507
But every time we send ours
troops up there, we are suffering losses.

279
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:10,511
Our machines dig up the hornet's nest.

280
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:15,516
After 10 minutes in the enemy
airspace they overwhelm us.

281
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:21,438
Colonel, we believe yours will
The blue team will be accepted as the home team

282
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,483
and will not cause an immune response.

283
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,486
And how can we test
that hypothesis, general?

284
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,489
In a hard way.

285
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,492
Excellent.

286
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:50,509
We are entering the hostile
air space. -I understand.

287
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,480
Brother! - Come on, Monkey!
- People, wait for me!

288
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,438
Tuk, keep up.
-OK OK.

289
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,481
Bro, why did you even take her?

290
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:51,486
She is a real robber. Says,
"I will say. You must not go to the battlefield."

291
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:54,364
"I'll tell mom if you don't take me."
- Don't tease her.

292
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,953
Come on.
- Crazy!

293
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:04,124
Are there any corpses up there?
-Brother, look at this. Come on.

294
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,512
Fuck it.

295
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,517
Curry? Kiri.

296
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,480
Kiri... Kiri.

297
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,775
Kiri.

298
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:19,491
Are you OK?
- I did that again, didn't I?

299
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:21,493
Yes you are.

300
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,461
Kiri!
- Kiri!

301
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,498
Kiri, we have to go back.
-Okay, come on.

302
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,339
What is that?

303
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,384
We should always be
at home before the eclipse.

304
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,347
It's too big to be human.
- Avatars?

305
00:28:42,389 -->00:28:45,392
Maybe, but certainly not ours.

306
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,354
What are you doing?
-I'm following the tracks.

307
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,375
Watch your back.

308
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,422
Clean.

309
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,426
Perimeter set up.

310
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,433
QUARITCH

311
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,399
Damn.

312
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,388
There's no way we should be here.

313
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:03,428
Dad will punish you.
- Can you stop? -For life.

314
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:07,432
Brother, we need to see this.
Here we go.

315
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:29,413
Brother, there are yours
dad and my dad fought.

316
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:33,417
That's your dad's suit.
- Holy to him.

317
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,838
Lyle, see if you can pull it off
some data from that camera.

318
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:42,426
That miracle is 100% dead.
-Like us.

319
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:47,431
I have to report this. - No, bro,
we will get into trouble. -Here we go.

320
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:56,398
Devil dog, this is Eagle Eye, reception.
- Eagle eye, say.

321
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,369
I see some guys.
They look like avatars,

322
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:07,409
but they wear camouflage gear
and assault rifles. There are 6 of them. Reception.

323
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:10,412
What is your position? Reception.

324
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,415
We are at the old cabin.

325
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,384
Who is "you"?

326
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,422
Me, Spider, Kiri...

327
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,425
and Tuk.

328
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:32,059
Son, listen to me very carefully.
Back off immediately. In silence.

329
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:35,854
Get out of there! Go! Do you hear?
- Yes, sir, we are leaving.

330
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:37,399
See, I told you.
- Let's go, let's go.

331
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,442
Dad, I know a faster way!

332
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:50,410
You're going to be in bad trouble.
-Kiri, stop it. - Guys, come on.

333
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:53,413
It's almost eclipse, come on.

334
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,418
Put it down! Down! Put it down
or I'll shoot you! -Follow me.

335
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:00,420
Throw it!
- Immediately!

336
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,800
Don't move! Hands up!
- Put it down. - Spiders.

337
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:12,391
Catch them! -Come here! Come on!
-Get on your knees! Don't resist!

338
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:16,395
Do not move.
- See if they have weapons. - Kiri!

339
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,398
keep calm...

340
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,441
Shut. Do not move.

341
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,444
What do we have here?

342
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:38,417
Colonel, watch this.
Four fingers. We have a half-tan.

343
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:39,962
Shit.

344
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:49,428
Show me your fingers.

345
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,434
You're his, aren't you?

346
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:00,397
You are his.

347
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:08,405
Where is he?

348
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:11,408
Unfortunately I don't speak English...

349
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:13,928
with assholes.

350
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:16,413
Where is your father?

351
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,425
Not!

352
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,420
Really? Do you want to play like this?

353
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,932
Shut!

354
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:34,431
Kiri! Not! Stop!
Don't touch her!

355
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,434
Don't hurt her, please.

356
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:42,397
Do not move.
- What's your name, kid?

357
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:48,403
Spider Socorro.

358
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,413
Miles?

359
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,918
Nobody calls me that.

360
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,425
I'll be damned. I thought
that they sent you back to Earth.

361
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,430
They can't fit babies
into hibernation, motherfucker.

362
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,355
What are we going to do, boss?

363
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,402
Steel Sky, Blue 1, Unit Leader.

364
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:36,410
Blue 1, Steel Sky, report.
- We are ready for the draw, reception.

365
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:42,374
Drive us. -The dragonfly goes left...
We're going to draw.

366
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,384
I warn you, we bring a lot
valuable prisoners. -Let us.

367
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,423
Shut! -Don't move, Blue 1, we're coming
to your position. - We will arrive in 10 minutes.

368
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,425
We're counting down.

369
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:55,929
Have a seat! - Come on, on the ground!
- Legs up! -Down to the ground!

370
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,765
Lyle, give me the sound for this.

371
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,101
Shut. Don't look up!

372
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:06,398
That's Sully's wife.
- She's an animal.

373
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,366
Surrender, Quarrel.

374
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,404
Sally. -It's over.
- Son of a bitch.

375
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,949
Nothing is over as long as I breathe.

376
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,452
I was hoping you would say that.

377
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:39,223
No, you stay with the screen. - But, Dad,
I'm a warrior like you. I need to fight.

378
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,433
We don't care.
- I won't repeat it.

379
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,437
Yes sir.

380
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,420
There is nothing after that.

381
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,435
Would you like us to pick up the leftovers?

382
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,422
Blue 1, get ready.
We're coming in 3 minutes.

383
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,425
Watch out, three minutes.

384
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,950
Cover our backs.

385
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,991
Shut!

386
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,974
Shut!

387
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,469
Contact back!
-Contact in the back!

388
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,483
Lo'ak!

389
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,019
Shit.

390
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,697
You little piece of shit!
- Lo'ak!

391
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,483
Tuk, come on. Here we go!
- Get back here!

392
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:38,028
Run away!
- Catch them!

393
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,451
Come on!

394
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:48,453
Take cover!

395
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:52,966
Come on!

396
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:13,478
Is that you, Mrs. Sally?
I recognize your business card.

397
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:29,453
Why don't you come out, Mrs. Sally?
You and I have some unfinished business.

398
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:38,462
Demon! I'll kill you how much
whenever I have to!

399
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:43,467
You and the corporal were
pretty valuable, right?

400
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:48,472
You've spawned a whole brood of half-wits.

401
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,482
Navi!

402
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,445
Run, run!

403
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:08,450
You OK? You okay, boy? -Yes. -Okay.
Follow me. Ready? -Yes sir!

404
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:12,963
Go!

405
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,968
Come on!

406
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:29,471
Run, run!
-Spread out. After them.

407
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:37,988
Spiders?

408
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,444
Spiders!
- Kiri. - Spiders.

409
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,411
Come over! Come on.

410
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,490
The spider is down there.
Not.

411
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:56,999
Madam, we have arrived. 10 minutes in
enemy airspace.

412
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,002
Blue 1, return to the assembly point.
Immediately.

413
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,469
Blue 1, back off.
- Retreat!

414
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:12,639
Retreat!
Here we go! Move!

415
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:15,442
Come on, come on.

416
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:19,438
Kiri! - Spider!
-Come come. -Not. -Come on.

417
00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:21,481
Run, run.
Come on. Here we go.

418
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,444
It's fine. Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

419
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:27,488
Tuk, are you hurt?
-Dad!

420
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,426
We are safe.
They are all good?

421
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:51,470
Mum!
- Knock.

422
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,433
It's fine. We are fine.

423
00:41:56,475 --> 00:42:00,479
Thank you, Great Mother.
Thank you.

424
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,440
Where is Spider?

425
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:07,444
They took him away.

426
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:10,823
Okay. It's okay, little one.
OK? He's a tough guy.

427
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,699
OK.

428
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,994
He will be fine.

429
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,457
We'll all be fine.

430
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,309
Damn it! Come on!

431
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,315
Let me out of here!

432
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:48,777
He is a complete savage.
He thinks he's one of them.

433
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,616
This thing. This Quaritch.
Whatever he is... - What's going on?

434
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:56,702
He can walk in right under Avey's nose.

435
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:01,790
This is our family, our home.
- It is about our family, our children.

436
00:43:01,825 --> 00:43:04,793
Can not. You can't ask for this.

437
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:10,757
I can't leave my people.
I will not.

438
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:14,761
He's chasing us.
He's targeting our family.

439
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:20,809
You can't ask for this.
Children only know about the forest. This is our home!

440
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:25,772
He caught our children.
He held a knife to their throats.

441
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,747
My father gave me this bow when he was dying.

442
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:41,753
He said I was protecting the people.
You are Toruk Makto!

443
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:46,793
This will protect people. It's corrupt
caught Spider. And that little guy knows everything.

444
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:49,796
He knows our whole operation
and can bring them right here.

445
00:43:49,831 --> 00:43:53,759
If people hide us,
will die.

446
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,802
Do you understand?

447
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:03,810
I have nothing. I don't have a plan...

448
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:08,816
But I can protect this family.
I can do that.

449
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,298
I know one thing.

450
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:31,797
wherever we go
this family is our fortress.

451
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:47,813
Where is Jake Sully?
-I do not know!

452
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,775
We know you do.
-I do not know!

453
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:55,779
Just form a picture in your mind.
Is that one of the floating mountains?

454
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,825
Let me out of here! - He resists us.
Give us a minute. -I do not know!

455
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:04,788
Just form a thought,
and we will see her.

456
00:45:04,823 --> 00:45:08,757
I do not know!
- I don't like this either, like you.

457
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:13,797
Which clans would hide him?
-I do not know! You will have to kill me!

458
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:17,301
Watch this. Abnormal activity
all over the frontal lobe.

459
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:21,763
This will not stop until we
you don't discover something. Where is he?

460
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,808
I don't know, you bastards! OK?
I do not know!

461
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,783
General, allow me
to try a personal approach.

462
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,873
He is not your son.

463
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,823
Calm down, tiger. Calm down.

464
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,416
Are we good?

465
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:42,803
Kid, you have the heart of a lion. Those bastards
the scientists put a lot of pressure on you.

466
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:45,848
But you didn't reveal anything to them.

467
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,852
I respect that.

468
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:55,858
I thought you might want this.

469
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:06,827
This is Colonel Miles Quaritch.
The deceased.

470
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:09,830
Killed in action.

471
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,802
I am not that man.

472
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:20,841
But I have his memories...

473
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,805
enough to know that...

474
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:29,808
he wasn't always the best father.

475
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,811
But this is not an apology.

476
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:37,858
I am not your father. Technically,
you and I are nothing to each other.

477
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:43,864
But I can help you.
I can get you out of here.

478
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:53,832
I'm not going to ask you to betray Jake Sully.
I know you would never do that. You are loyal.

479
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:57,836
And I admire loyalty.

480
00:47:57,871 --> 00:48:00,839
Just come with me.

481
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,843
Otherwise, I'll have to send you back
laboratory coats.

482
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:16,814
This is very heavy on my heart.

483
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:22,820
Tarsem is wise for his years.
It will be a strong Olo'eiktan.

484
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:26,824
The leader must die.

485
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:33,831
How a leader could be born.

486
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:37,835
Toruk Makto will disappear.

487
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:42,840
The people will be safe.

488
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:12,870
Father protects.
That is its purpose.

489
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,835
One life ends.

490
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,837
The second begins.

491
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,852
Knock.

492
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:45,819
The sea clans are a world unto themselves.
Thousand Islands.

493
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:50,824
Unknown territory on which
we could disappear without a trace.

494
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:52,868
Are we there yet?

495
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,688
AVA'ATLU, METKAJINA VILLAGE

496
00:50:59,284 --> 00:51:01,387
Leave it.

497
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:03,589
Follow me.

498
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:06,175
Knock.

499
00:51:07,343 --> 00:51:08,970
Behave yourself.

500
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:11,639
Behave yourself.

501
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,619
Slowly. Just calm.

502
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:36,664
See. What is that?
That's supposed to be the tail?

503
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:56,642
It's too small. How will they swim?

504
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:59,645
Don't. Roto, Ao'nung.

505
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:03,157
Bye.

506
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:32,637
Tonovari was the chief of Metkajin,
The Greben people.

507
00:52:32,672 --> 00:52:35,681
I see you, Tonovari.
- Jakesley.

508
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:39,644
I knew him as a solid leader.

509
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:45,650
But Tonovari was not the one
which worried me.

510
00:52:48,653 --> 00:52:51,656
I see you, Ronal.
Tsahik Metkajina.

511
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:53,658
I see you, Ronal.

512
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,622
Why did you come to us, Jakesal?
- We are looking for a groove.

513
00:52:59,664 --> 00:53:03,668
Utura?
- Yes, a haven for my family.

514
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:09,840
We are the Greben people.
You are the Forest People.

515
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,926
Your skills will be useless here.

516
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:15,638
We will learn your customs.
Am I right? -Yes.

517
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:20,643
Their hands are thin.

518
00:53:21,644 --> 00:53:26,649
Mum. - Their tails are weak.
You will be slow in the water.

519
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:33,489
These kids aren't even real Na'vi.
-Dad.

520
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:36,659
Yes we are!

521
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:41,172
They have demonic blood!

522
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:47,178
See.

523
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:52,675
I was born of the people of Heaven, and now I am
Na'vi. OK? You can adapt.

524
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:56,637
We will adapt. OK?

525
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:59,640
My husband was Toruk Makto.

526
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:06,605
He led the clans to victory
over the Heavenly People.

527
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:13,154
You call this a win?
Hiding among strangers?

528
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:21,370
Looks like you're Ava
turned her back, the Chosen One.

529
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:30,046
I'm sorry about my wife.
- Don't apologize for me.

530
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:32,465
She has flown for a long time and is exhausted.
- Jake.

531
00:54:37,678 --> 00:54:43,684
Toruk Makto is a great war leader.
All the Na'vi people know his story.

532
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:47,688
But we Metkajin... -Dad.
- We are not at war.

533
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,652
We can't let you
to bring your war here.

534
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:55,655
I'm done with the war. OK?

535
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:59,700
I just want to protect my family.

536
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:05,706
Uturu was requested.

537
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,964
Do we have to leave?
- We'll be fine.

538
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:28,653
Toruk Makto and his
the family will stay with us.

539
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:34,694
Treat them as our brothers and sisters.
They don't know the sea.

540
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:40,658
Therefore it will be like
babies who took their first breath.

541
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,705
Teach them our customs, so they don't
suffered the shame of being useless.

542
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,112
What do we say?
-Thank you.

543
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:51,764
Thank you.
-Thank you.

544
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:53,200
Thank you.

545
00:55:53,202 --> 00:55:56,289
My son, Ao'nung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

546
00:55:57,248 --> 00:55:59,250
Father why...
-It was decided.

547
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:02,253
Come, I will show you our village.

548
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:14,816
This way.

549
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:18,778
Knock, let's go.

550
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:21,731
Up here.

551
00:56:28,706 --> 00:56:32,710
This is for you. Your new home.

552
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:36,672
Yes, this will do.
This is great.

553
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:38,841
It's nice, isn't it?

554
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:54,482
Salijevi, choir.
-You remember? Family meeting.

555
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:57,193
Kneel down. Come on.
- Kiri.

556
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:59,070
What is it?
-Okay.

557
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:05,242
Children, be on your best behavior.
I really mean it.

558
00:57:05,284 --> 00:57:10,247
Learn fast, engage.
Don't cause trouble. Clear?

559
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:12,291
Yes sir.

560
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:17,254
I want to go home.

561
00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:19,215
Oh, Tuck.

562
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:23,260
Tuk, this is our home now.

563
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,224
We will get through this.

564
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:33,270
We'll get through this if we look out for each other
others. OK? - What does your father always say?

565
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:36,238
The Salis stick together.

566
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:40,277
That's right. The Salis stick together.
This time with a bit of fervor.

567
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:46,283
Yes. - The Sullies stick together.
- The Sullies stick together.

568
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:47,828
The Salis stick together.

569
00:57:57,253 --> 00:57:58,763
Come on.

570
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,269
Swim with us.

571
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:16,267
What's wrong with them?
- They are bad divers.

572
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:19,270
Stop it. They study.

573
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,243
Are you ok?
- You're too fast. Wait for us.

574
01:00:34,285 --> 01:00:36,996
Just breathe.
Breathe.

575
01:00:37,288 --> 01:00:41,250
You are not good divers. Maybe you are
good at swinging through trees but...

576
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:46,339
Come on bro. - We don't understand the language
fingers, people. We don't know what you are saying.

577
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:50,009
I will teach you.
- Where is Kiri? - Kiri? - Who? - Kiri.

578
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:52,303
Where's Kiri?
- Have you seen her?

579
01:01:03,272 --> 01:01:08,235
Get on board, find a seat,
and don't bother.

580
01:01:08,277 --> 01:01:12,239
Here we go! Hurry up.
- Extra.

581
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:15,242
Stop, dude!

582
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:20,247
Listen.
The transmitter is built into that mask.

583
01:01:20,289 --> 01:01:24,251
When we get down and you take her off,
I'll call you back in two minutes

584
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:29,215
and I'll beat you up the old fashioned way.
Clear?

585
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:32,259
Clear?
-Yes sir.

586
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:34,303
We boarded?
- The team has boarded.

587
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:54,240
Listen up. Jake Sully went into hiding.

588
01:01:54,281 --> 01:02:00,287
Does not matter. wherever it is,
we will find him and his crazy wife.

589
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:05,251
To do that, we must become Na'vi.

590
01:02:05,293 --> 01:02:07,253
As soon as possible, completely.

591
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:13,259
That means we have to eat like the Na'vi.
Ride like a Na'vi. Thinking like a Na'vi.

592
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:18,306
And that starts with speaking the language.

593
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:26,355
You call that speaking in tongues?
You sound like a three year old!

594
01:02:28,357 --> 01:02:30,359
Okay, smart guy.

595
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:35,323
You're just from the monkey mascot
became the official translator.

596
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:47,335
These are ilu. If you want tolive here
you have to ride.

597
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:51,297
Gently make the connection.

598
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:59,305
Feel his breath.
Feel his strength.

599
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:02,308
Hold on here.

600
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,312
Look at his legs.
-Hold on.

601
01:03:25,331 --> 01:03:27,291
How are you, forest boy?

602
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:44,016
This is a war mustang. It is not easy to learn.
Maybe you should start with ilo.

603
01:03:44,308 --> 01:03:46,310
Not. This one.

604
01:03:48,312 --> 01:03:54,318
Remember, when you dive,
good position. Very important.

605
01:03:58,322 --> 01:04:00,324
I can do this.

606
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:26,818
That's right, okay.

607
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:29,312
Peacefully.

608
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:46,329
Shit.

609
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:17,318
I love her already.

610
01:05:56,732 --> 01:05:59,318
Take a breath.

611
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,281
And exhale.

612
01:06:04,323 --> 01:06:08,285
Imagine a flickering flame.

613
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:11,330
You have to slow down your heart rate.

614
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:15,293
Take a breath.

615
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:18,296
Breathe from here.

616
01:06:18,337 --> 01:06:22,300
Exhale slowly.

617
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:27,555
Lo'ak, your heart is beating fast.
-Sorry. -Try to focus.

618
01:06:27,763 --> 01:06:29,765
Okay.
-Take a breath.

619
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:35,313
And exhale.
Clear your mind.

620
01:06:53,331 --> 01:06:55,333
Learn to breathe.

621
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,715
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

622
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:18,773
I will do it.

623
01:07:25,529 --> 01:07:29,867
What is it? -Na'vi children younger than me
they do it with their bare hands.

624
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:34,789
Jake Sully did it the hard way?
-What do you think?

625
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,303
What are we going to do, Colonel?

626
01:07:43,756 --> 01:07:46,759
This will be good.

627
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:51,272
Okay, let's go ahead.

628
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:59,772
You and me, cookie.

629
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:15,788
Did I mention
that you should tie his mouth first?

630
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:18,299
Thanks a lot, kid!

631
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:24,305
Go ahead!

632
01:08:32,054 --> 01:08:34,056
Do you see them?

633
01:08:54,785 --> 01:08:58,789
Okay, let's go.
We're leaving. Come on.

634
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:02,301
Here we go. We're getting out of here.

635
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:10,801
That! That's right!

636
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:15,273
That, Colonel!
Go ahead!

637
01:09:15,806 --> 01:09:18,768
Who's next?

638
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:30,780
The path of water has no beginning and no end.

639
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:38,788
The sea is around you and in you.

640
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:48,756
The sea is your home before your birth...

641
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:52,802
and after your death.

642
01:09:57,765 --> 01:10:02,144
Our hearts beat in the womb of the world.

643
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:07,775
Our breath burns in the shadows of the deep.

644
01:10:09,777 --> 01:10:14,782
The sea gives and the sea takes.

645
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,787
Water connects all things.

646
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,792
Life and death.

647
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:29,755
Darkness and light.

648
01:10:31,757 --> 01:10:35,803
I have her! Tsireia!
-You made it!

649
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:54,822
This allows us to breathe underwater.

650
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:39,784
What is she doing?

651
01:11:39,825 --> 01:11:43,829
I do not know.
- He's just looking at the sand.

652
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,791
What did you say?

653
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:49,794
Are you some kind of freak?

654
01:11:49,835 --> 01:11:52,755
He asked if you were a freak.

655
01:11:54,799 --> 01:11:56,342
Not.

656
01:11:56,801 --> 01:11:59,804
Are you sure?
- You're not even a real Na'vi.

657
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:02,807
Look at those hands.
Look at them.

658
01:12:04,809 --> 01:12:06,776
Tutanj, fishmouth!

659
01:12:06,811 --> 01:12:10,898
Another four-toed freak.
-Look at his little baby tail!

660
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:14,819
Don't touch me! - Baby's tail! - Leave it
leave us alone! -He is not normal.

661
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:16,319
Look at his tail.

662
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,614
Baby tail! He is so cute!

663
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:23,119
You heard what she said.
Leave them alone.

664
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:25,746
Big brother has come...

665
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:29,417
Step back. Immediately.

666
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:40,678
Smart decision.
And in the future, respect my sister.

667
01:12:45,433 --> 01:12:47,101
Here we go.

668
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:50,778
Bye!

669
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:54,817
They're all freaks. The whole family.

670
01:12:56,736 --> 01:12:58,821
Lo'ak.
- I can do this, bro.

671
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:06,579
I know this hand is weird.
Look, I'm a freak. Foreigner.

672
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:12,793
But she can do something really cool.
Watch. First, I squeeze her hard like this.

673
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:14,837
OK? Then...

674
01:13:18,758 --> 01:13:22,803
That's called a blow, cunt!
Don't touch my sister again.

675
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:24,348
That! Ao'nung!
Show him!

676
01:13:27,975 --> 01:13:29,485
Come here!

677
01:13:34,482 --> 01:13:35,992
Stop it!

678
01:13:36,484 --> 01:13:38,361
Stop it!

679
01:13:40,488 --> 01:13:41,998
It's very stupid!

680
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:46,959
My tail!

681
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:51,832
My ear! Let go!
He grabbed my ear!

682
01:13:56,796 --> 01:13:59,757
What's the only thing I asked for? Only!
- Let's stay out of trouble.

683
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:01,849
To stay out of trouble. Yes.
-It's my fault.

684
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:04,845
I would not say. You have to stop
you take the blame for this idiot.

685
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,807
Look, dad. Ao'nung bullied Kiri.
He called her a freak.

686
01:14:11,811 --> 01:14:16,816
Go apologize to Ao'nung. -What?
- He is the chief's son. Do you understand?

687
01:14:17,817 --> 01:14:21,821
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make up. Go.

688
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:31,831
What do the others look like?
-Up.

689
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:35,126
That's good.
-Much worse.

690
01:14:35,793 --> 01:14:37,336
Get out of here.

691
01:14:48,806 --> 01:14:50,850
What's up with you?

692
01:14:51,809 --> 01:14:56,397
Nothing. I'm all right.
Why shouldn't I be fine?

693
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:07,783
Why can't I be like everyone else?

694
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:09,827
Kiri...

695
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:15,833
What is the forest boy doing here?

696
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:21,756
Sorry for hitting you.
So many times.

697
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:30,806
We should be friends.

698
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:36,854
Come hunt with us. Off the reef.
Where men hunt.

699
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:42,818
By no means. I'm not allowed.
- I must be asking the wrong brother.

700
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:45,821
Let's do it.

701
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:01,345
Come on!

702
01:16:10,805 --> 01:16:12,807
Keep up, forest boy!

703
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:20,815
THE ROCKS OF THE THREE BROTHERS

704
01:16:27,822 --> 01:16:31,826
You survived!
- That was crazy, bro!

705
01:16:32,827 --> 01:16:34,829
Over here. I know a good place.

706
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,343
Call the fish.

707
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:06,819
What a moron!

708
01:17:26,797 --> 01:17:29,842
The boys!

709
01:17:32,803 --> 01:17:34,770
Ao'nung!

710
01:17:34,805 --> 01:17:36,849
Come on, this isn't funny!

711
01:17:48,778 --> 01:17:50,288
Ao'nung!

712
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:25,336
Congratulations to him.

713
01:21:54,815 --> 01:21:56,817
You are a tulkun.

714
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:01,822
You saved my life. Thank you.

715
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:05,334
Thank you.

716
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:13,834
Dude, I have no idea what you just said.

717
01:22:19,799 --> 01:22:21,801
They hurt you, didn't they?

718
01:22:23,844 --> 01:22:26,346
I'll try to get this out.

719
01:22:26,381 --> 01:22:28,849
Just trust me, okay?

720
01:23:03,551 --> 01:23:05,553
Friends?

721
01:23:07,805 --> 01:23:10,808
That's right, we're friends.
Friends.

722
01:23:14,812 --> 01:23:16,322
Brother!

723
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:28,844
I'm sorry.

724
01:25:07,758 --> 01:25:11,846
What is it, baby?
Do you miss Spider?

725
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:16,692
Yes.
-Yes?

726
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:19,437
But that's not the point.

727
01:25:20,813 --> 01:25:25,776
Okay. What's the matter?

728
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:29,321
I feel her, Dad.

729
01:25:29,356 --> 01:25:32,825
Who do you feel?
- Eve.

730
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:42,793
I can hear her breathing.
I can hear her heartbeat.

731
01:25:43,544 --> 01:25:45,755
She is very close.

732
01:25:46,172 --> 01:25:48,507
She is here...

733
01:25:50,176 --> 01:25:52,678
like a word on the tip of the tongue.

734
01:25:57,808 --> 01:26:00,811
I know you think I'm crazy.

735
01:26:01,854 --> 01:26:03,814
You're not crazy, little one.

736
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:10,821
What does Avey's heartbeat sound like?

737
01:26:15,826 --> 01:26:18,829
Powerful.

738
01:26:24,835 --> 01:26:27,797
Tell him what you told me!

739
01:26:32,802 --> 01:26:34,845
Do you like to look at the stars?

740
01:26:37,807 --> 01:26:39,809
My dad came from a star.

741
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:42,812
Oh no. Right there.

742
01:26:45,815 --> 01:26:48,818
Lo'ak!
- Oh, man. I'm in trouble.

743
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:53,948
Go. I'll see you again.

744
01:27:11,799 --> 01:27:14,844
The boy is back!
- That's Sally's son.

745
01:27:14,879 --> 01:27:16,804
They found a boyfriend.
- They found him.

746
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:26,862
To see you. Okay.

747
01:27:26,897 --> 01:27:31,861
Good. Yes.
Just a few scratches.

748
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:37,867
I pray that I find strength
not to gouge out the eyes of my youngest son!

749
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:43,873
Not. My son knew
that he should not lead him outside the reef.

750
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,385
He is guilty.

751
01:27:48,878 --> 01:27:50,388
Okay. Here we go.

752
01:27:50,553 --> 01:27:54,432
Not. Ao'nung is not to blame.
It was my idea.

753
01:27:55,433 --> 01:27:57,852
Ao'nung tried
to talk me out of it.

754
01:27:57,894 --> 01:28:00,500
Really.
-Come on.

755
01:28:00,535 --> 01:28:03,107
Lo'ak.
-I'm sorry.

756
01:28:03,274 --> 01:28:05,443
Come on.

757
01:28:07,445 -->01:28:09,447
I will take care of this.

758
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:15,453
Is it true?
- Ao'nung. Where was your mind?

759
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:20,500
Dad, you said yes
I make friends with those kids.

760
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:22,627
I was just trying to...
- I don't want to listen.

761
01:28:22,919 --> 01:28:25,463
Dad...
- You disgraced this family.

762
01:28:28,466 --> 01:28:32,095
can i go now
-Next time, I'll tie your tail in a knot.

763
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:36,432
Do you hear?
-Yes sir. Loud and clear.

764
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:50,446
Where were you? -Yes. What happened
with that "keep an eye on your brother" thing?

765
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:52,448
Excuse me, sir.

766
01:28:56,452 --> 01:28:58,454
Why did you take my guilt upon yourself?

767
01:28:59,455 --> 01:29:03,459
Because I know what it's like to be
one big disappointment.

768
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:10,174
I wish I was there.
The ocean has blessed you with a gift, brother.

769
01:29:10,592 --> 01:29:15,388
The Tulkunis haven't returned yet. After all,
no tulkun is ever alone.

770
01:29:15,763 --> 01:29:17,355
This one was.

771
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:21,060
One of his fins was missing.
He had a stump. On the left side.

772
01:29:21,144 --> 01:29:22,654
Poor tulkun.

773
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:25,440
A spider.
-What?

774
01:29:25,481 --> 01:29:29,444
Who is Pajakan?
- A young male who broke away.

775
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:32,412
He is an exile.
Alone. And his fins are missing.

776
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:39,412
They say he's a murderer. -No no.
- He killed the Na'vi and other tulkuns.

777
01:29:39,454 --> 01:29:43,458
Not here, but far to the south.
- No, he's not a murderer.

778
01:29:43,499 --> 01:29:48,796
Lo'ak. You're lucky to be alive.
- I'm telling you, people. He saved my life.

779
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:52,425
He is my friend.
-My little brother!

780
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:57,430
A mighty warrior faced
with a tulkun murderer and survived.

781
01:29:58,431 --> 01:30:01,399
You're not listening, people.

782
01:30:01,434 --> 01:30:06,439
Lo'ak, I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back. -Idiots.

783
01:30:06,689 --> 01:30:08,199
Spiders!

784
01:30:09,692 --> 01:30:11,202
Spiders!

785
01:30:12,695 --> 01:30:14,697
Spiders!

786
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:24,707
I am glad to see you.

787
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:29,712
Why are you an exile?
What happened?

788
01:30:30,713 --> 01:30:33,716
It's too painful.

789
01:30:34,717 --> 01:30:40,640
I trust you.
You can trust me.

790
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:27,729
Bro, that's disgusting.

791
01:31:31,691 --> 01:31:33,693
Go faster!

792
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:11,613
Here we are.

793
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:22,162
This is the Cove of the Ancestors.
Our most sacred place.

794
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:31,171
The eclipse is the best time of day
to be here.

795
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:48,188
Here it is. This is the Tree of Souls.

796
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:56,632
My beautiful daughter.

797
01:33:56,674 --> 01:33:58,634
Hi, Mom.

798
01:33:58,676 --> 01:34:02,596
I am very happy to see you.
But you look upset.

799
01:34:08,602 --> 01:34:11,689
My sweet little girl.
It'll be fine.

800
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:24,660
What is it, honey?
- Why am I different?

801
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:28,664
What does the Great Mother want from me?

802
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:34,670
Who was my father?

803
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:40,676
My soul.

804
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,140
Not!

805
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:05,659
Come on!
- Kiri!

806
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,662
Kiri!

807
01:35:10,664 --> 01:35:14,626
What is wrong? What is it?
- She had a seizure.

808
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:16,178
Is he breathing?

809
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:18,097
Is he breathing?

810
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:24,678
Take her to the village! Hurry up!
-Here we go! Let's move! - Knock, come on.

811
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:41,652
Hello!
-I am glad to see you.

812
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,031
Let's get the equipment. We don't care!
Netejame, keep them away.

813
01:35:44,066 --> 01:35:46,700
How is she?
- He is still unconscious.

814
01:35:46,735 --> 01:35:49,668
No bleeding.
There are no fractures.

815
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:52,706
No signs of hypoxia.
The brain looks good.

816
01:35:57,711 --> 01:36:01,263
But we have interictal activity
here in the frontal lobe.

817
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:05,678
Okay. - She must have had a seizure.
We can shed toxins. - So what is it?

818
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:10,683
I see I'm not needed here.
- You are Tsahik!

819
01:36:11,684 --> 01:36:16,313
Put those things away. -Outside!
You have done nothing!

820
01:36:16,355 --> 01:36:20,693
Come on. We will take a break. -Just a little.
I have to turn off her IV.

821
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:23,204
Tuktirei.

822
01:36:30,703 --> 01:36:34,581
She said she could feel Ava.
He can hear her heartbeat.

823
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:38,460
That's it. -What? - It's a classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

824
01:36:38,495 --> 01:36:41,046
Epilepsy?
-Yes. You see visions.

825
01:36:41,088 --> 01:36:44,758
You enter into states of religious ecstasy
such as those she describes.

826
01:36:52,683 --> 01:36:55,644
Connecting with the Treesoul
is a kind of trigger.

827
01:36:55,686 --> 01:36:59,690
You can't let her do that again.

828
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:01,235
What? Never?

829
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:06,697
Jake. If he has another attack
underwater, it could kill her.

830
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:20,711
Kiri. You're awake!

831
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:28,726
Oh, Kiri.

832
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:32,723
Kiri, my sweet child.
My sweet little girl.

833
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:36,643
Okay, this, "I see you."

834
01:37:42,024 --> 01:37:43,692
That's what I said, didn't I?

835
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:47,738
Not "Naati. Ngaati."

836
01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:51,700
Okay. It's like it's coming out of your nose.

837
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:56,121
Chief, long range patrol
she picked up something on the radar.

838
01:37:56,163 --> 01:37:57,831
Rogue fighter aircraft.

839
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:01,710
Where? - Eastern Sea.
400 km north.

840
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,714
Hold on.

841
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:12,179
The signal was intermittent, and we lost it
are in the open sea but...

842
01:38:12,221 --> 01:38:17,643
If we continue the trail,
this group of islands is reached.

843
01:38:17,685 --> 01:38:22,648
There are hundreds of islands. That's a big one
search space with many islands.

844
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:27,695
That's our guy. Give me the ships
aircraft, and I'll bring you his scalp.

845
01:38:39,707 --> 01:38:41,217
Flyers are coming.
- Captain.

846
01:38:49,717 --> 01:38:53,679
Stop everything. - Stop everything.
- Stop everything. I understand.

847
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:15,666
Bye.
- Are you Scoresby?

848
01:39:15,701 --> 01:39:18,704
You're an asshole requisitioning my ship?

849
01:39:18,739 --> 01:39:21,665
That would be me.

850
01:39:21,707 --> 01:39:25,669
The target is practically this entire archipelago.

851
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:30,674
I've never been there.
You know the waters, Doc. Who lives there?

852
01:39:30,716 --> 01:39:34,678
Bullets, mostly.
Something Ta'unui. Maybe 50 villages.

853
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,680
And who are you?

854
01:39:36,722 --> 01:39:41,608
I'm Ian Garvin. Marine biologist.

855
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:45,481
Fifty villages. A hundred villages. Does not matter.
We will search them all.

856
01:39:45,731 --> 01:39:49,575
I hunt tulkuns.
I am equipped for that.

857
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:52,279
That's what my boys do.
I need to meet the standards.

858
01:39:53,697 --> 01:39:57,701
I'll be good for once.
Then I won't.

859
01:40:00,704 --> 01:40:04,667
If you can't snap out of it,
then get into it!

860
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:08,712
All crews to their positions!
-Dont touch!

861
01:40:09,713 --> 01:40:12,716
Helmsman, pick him up. Airplane speed.
- Airplane speed, I understand.

862
01:40:23,852 --> 01:40:27,940
What was that?
-What happens?

863
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:35,823
Tulkoons are back! people,
our brothers and sisters are back.

864
01:40:45,916 --> 01:40:50,921
In its endless cycle
migration, tulkuns came home.

865
01:40:55,509 --> 01:40:56,926
Kiri!

866
01:40:56,927 --> 01:41:00,472
Kiri, come on. Come on!
-Tuk, leave me alone.

867
01:41:00,507 --> 01:41:02,057
Come on!
-What is it?

868
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:05,894
What do you want?
-Take a look at!

869
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:07,730
Take a look at.

870
01:41:14,528 --> 01:41:17,871
Come on. Let's go meet them.

871
01:41:17,906 --> 01:41:19,908
See...
That's my spiritual sister.

872
01:42:16,924 --> 01:42:19,927
Sister, I see you.

873
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,930
I see you, sister. I'm happy.

874
01:42:28,894 --> 01:42:32,898
Your son is beautiful.

875
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:35,901
Thank you. how is your baby

876
01:42:36,902 --> 01:42:39,905
My baby is strong.

877
01:42:41,907 --> 01:42:43,417
I met a guy.

878
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:48,288
It was a time for stories.
About the time they spent apart.

879
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:50,916
About death and births.

880
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:56,463
About old friends and new loves.

881
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:13,996
THE VILLAGE OF TA'UNUI

882
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:15,741
Children.

883
01:43:18,535 --> 01:43:20,896
Be still, my people.

884
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,054
We are looking for weapons, communication equipment.
Any technical devices.

885
01:43:25,096 --> 01:43:27,973
Down! And you!
Do you see this?

886
01:43:28,557 --> 01:43:30,351
Stay down and shut up!

887
01:43:32,937 --> 01:43:38,275
This man...
We know it's on these islands.

888
01:43:38,526 --> 01:43:40,036
Here? In this village?

889
01:43:40,111 --> 01:43:45,950
We are a completely separate clan.
That man in the reflection is from the forest.

890
01:43:46,951 --> 01:43:49,001
What does he say?
- They never saw him.

891
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:51,580
This is the Sea People.
Forest folk don't come here.

892
01:43:51,622 --> 01:43:53,916
I don't believe in that.

893
01:43:58,003 --> 01:44:01,966
He has to get out of here
and went into the forest to find that man.

894
01:44:04,969 --> 01:44:06,512
They don't know anything.

895
01:44:08,973 --> 01:44:12,017
Shoot that animal.

896
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:16,272
What the hell are you doing?

897
01:44:24,029 --> 01:44:26,991
Calm down.

898
01:44:27,032 --> 01:44:30,995
Are your ears working now? -Calm down!
- Do you see what this can do?

899
01:44:33,622 --> 01:44:38,002
Jake Sully. Toruk Makto!

900
01:44:38,335 --> 01:44:40,170
He told you he didn't know!

901
01:44:40,205 --> 01:44:42,006
Put her down!
-Down!

902
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:43,551
Down!

903
01:44:45,259 --> 01:44:46,718
Stop it! Stop it!

904
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:51,870
Make it clear to him.
If you don't hand Sali, we will kill Tsahik.

905
01:44:51,905 --> 01:44:57,021
No, I won't do that.
-Is that so? - I don't want to be a part of this.

906
01:44:58,022 --> 01:45:01,317
Down! - These people don't know anything!
They don't know anything!

907
01:45:01,358 --> 01:45:02,902
Don't move!

908
01:45:03,027 --> 01:45:04,537
Stay down!

909
01:45:05,071 --> 01:45:06,581
Shut!

910
01:45:07,031 --> 01:45:08,991
Are we really going to rock it?

911
01:45:09,992 --> 01:45:12,828
Please. Please don't do that.
That's wrong.

912
01:45:13,162 --> 01:45:14,955
What you are doing here is wrong.

913
01:45:16,582 --> 01:45:18,584
Please.

914
01:45:22,004 --> 01:45:25,973
Burn the huts.
- Set them on fire.

915
01:45:26,008 --> 01:45:28,660
Burn them. All!
- Flamethrowers up.

916
01:45:28,770 --> 01:45:30,270
Burn them!

917
01:45:41,023 --> 01:45:45,986
I'm sorry. I did not know!
-Stop this madness!

918
01:45:46,028 --> 01:45:50,991
I'm sorry.
- Let's get out of here.

919
01:45:51,033 --> 01:45:53,035
Don't touch me!

920
01:45:53,369 --> 01:45:54,879
I'm sorry.
-Here we go.

921
01:45:55,287 --> 01:45:57,498
Get on. OK. Here we go.

922
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:25,111
What is it?
- Sky people.

923
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:28,990
They're looking for you, Jakesal. On the south.

924
01:46:29,407 --> 01:46:32,327
It is human with them
Na'vi speaking boy.

925
01:46:36,122 --> 01:46:39,125
Did they kill someone?
-They still have not.

926
01:46:41,085 --> 01:46:46,090
Threaten. But the villagers won't tell them where you are.
According to my order.

927
01:46:54,098 --> 01:47:00,104
We have to find that demon.
Catch him. Kill him.

928
01:47:00,139 --> 01:47:03,072
We have to be smart.

929
01:47:03,107 --> 01:47:07,070
We have to be smart.
If we attack Quaritch, they'll know where we are,

930
01:47:07,105 --> 01:47:08,863
and they will come here with everything they have.

931
01:47:10,114 --> 01:47:13,076
So what is our plan?

932
01:47:13,785 --> 01:47:18,122
It's Toruk Makto! - Head down.
- Was he here?

933
01:47:22,794 --> 01:47:25,797
There is no point in this.
- No, they are dragging us.

934
01:47:26,714 --> 01:47:32,804
If we press harder, he will continue
to run away. We have to get him out into the open.

935
01:47:41,104 --> 01:47:45,108
I'm done with this.
I need to meet the standards.

936
01:47:45,143 --> 01:47:48,111
Do you want to hunt?
We are hunting.

937
01:47:49,112 --> 01:47:52,080
Here? Not here.
There are too many villages.

938
01:47:52,115 --> 01:47:56,536
Not. No no.
Sincerely, sir...

939
01:47:57,286 --> 01:48:01,499
You don't understand the close connections between
tulkun and oceanic Na'vi.

940
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:03,835
That would be like im
you kill a family member.

941
01:48:03,876 --> 01:48:07,213
If we start hunting here,
the enemies will attack us.

942
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:11,384
Exactly.
One enemy in particular.

943
01:48:21,686 --> 01:48:24,689
I know how you feel.

944
01:48:26,274 --> 01:48:29,277
I feel all alone too.

945
01:48:30,945 --> 01:48:34,949
Tell me. Why are you an exile?

946
01:50:57,258 --> 01:51:00,928
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

947
01:51:03,931 --> 01:51:06,934
It's fine.

948
01:51:21,157 --> 01:51:24,118
You allowed this.

949
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:28,164
You let him bond with an exile!

950
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:35,046
Tsireia. You disappoint me, daughter.

951
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:40,843
And you, son of a great warrior,
they didn't teach you that way.

952
01:51:40,885 --> 01:51:45,139
The spider saved my life, sir.
You don't know him. - No, Lo'ak.

953
01:51:46,265 --> 01:51:47,775
Have a seat.

954
01:51:48,434 --> 01:51:50,436
Have a seat.

955
01:51:52,146 --> 01:51:54,148
Sit down!

956
01:51:58,027 --> 01:52:01,489
Hear my words, boy.

957
01:52:01,531 --> 01:52:06,995
In the days of the First Songs,
tulkuns fought among themselves,

958
01:52:07,036 --> 01:52:10,623
for territory and for revenge.

959
01:52:11,207 --> 01:52:16,004
But they realized that killing,
no matter how justified,

960
01:52:16,045 --> 01:52:20,028
it only leads to more killing.

961
01:52:20,063 --> 01:52:24,331
So killing is forbidden.

962
01:52:24,366 --> 01:52:28,599
Such is the custom of tulkuns.

963
01:52:28,683 --> 01:52:34,314
A spider is a killer,
that's why he's an exile.

964
01:52:34,605 --> 01:52:39,277
I'm sorry, sir. But you are wrong.
- Lo'ak. You are talking to Olo'ejktan.

965
01:52:39,319 --> 01:52:42,155
I know what...
-Enough!

966
01:52:45,783 --> 01:52:47,785
I know what I know.

967
01:52:50,413 --> 01:52:52,415
Enough.

968
01:52:53,416 --> 01:52:55,418
I'll take care of him.

969
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:03,176
This storm will pass.

970
01:53:04,135 --> 01:53:08,146
Lo'ak, I saw something today.

971
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:12,185
I saw sh
a smart guy
who was chosen by the tulkun.

972
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:14,187
I am very proud of you.

973
01:53:15,146 --> 01:53:18,740
The spider didn't kill those guys.
I saw it all.

974
01:53:18,775 --> 01:53:22,945
The demon ship killed the mother exactly
in front of him. He gathered the young males

975
01:53:22,987 --> 01:53:26,991
and reef boys to attack the ship.
And they killed them all...

976
01:53:28,234 --> 01:53:31,779
Heavenly people. Not him.
He is not a murderer. - No, Lo'ak.

977
01:53:31,821 --> 01:53:35,992
According to the tulkun custom, it is.
He is responsible for those deaths.

978
01:53:36,034 --> 01:53:38,418
Does it have to work out
because of that the rest of your life?

979
01:53:38,453 --> 01:53:41,831
He knows that what he did was
wrong. He would never do it again.

980
01:53:42,707 --> 01:53:44,166
We have to tell my father...

981
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:46,252
Not. I already have enough
problems with his father.

982
01:53:46,294 --> 01:53:50,757
Your father will understand this.
- No, it won't. He doesn't understand anything.

983
01:53:51,007 --> 01:53:55,411
The whole clan hates me. Demon blood.
Foreigner. They just see it.

984
01:54:01,768 --> 01:54:03,278
I see you.

985
01:54:08,441 --> 01:54:11,444
You are the tulkun's brother.

986
01:54:13,404 --> 01:54:14,914
You are one of us now.

987
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:36,185
Did you find your mother? -Mother and cub.
Strong signal. Distance, 4,000.

988
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:40,956
Insert it into the hull of the ship.
- I'm hanging up, I understand.

989
01:55:03,212 --> 01:55:06,132
Underwater teams, two minutes!
Get in there!

990
01:55:06,174 --> 01:55:07,800
The door is closed!

991
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:10,094
Come on, faster! Faster!

992
01:55:10,178 --> 01:55:13,890
Crews in their ships.
Two minutes. Let's make some money.

993
01:55:14,891 --> 01:55:19,187
Ship crews! let's
let's release the ropes! Release the ropes!

994
01:55:24,192 --> 01:55:26,194
All ships in the water!
Ships in the water!

995
01:55:30,815 --> 01:55:32,817
Let's go, babe!

996
01:55:43,223 --> 01:55:45,016
Here we go!

997
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:14,504
Prepare the depth charges
and fire, fire, fire!

998
01:56:36,526 --> 01:56:39,452
What is that?
What are they doing?

999
01:56:39,487 --> 01:56:43,456
These are echolocation sensors.
That's how they manage.

1000
01:56:43,491 --> 01:56:46,536
They have to keep them above the surface of the water,
or they will go deaf.

1001
01:56:47,495 --> 01:56:51,499
Picadores! Get in there!
Come on. Get in there. Get in there!

1002
01:57:07,515 --> 01:57:11,478
It will isolate the female from the rest of the flock
using a sound cannon.

1003
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:16,983
They target the mother because the cub swims slowly,
and she won't leave him.

1004
01:57:17,018 --> 01:57:21,488
Do they sometimes resist?
- No, they never raised their fins.

1005
01:57:21,529 --> 01:57:27,494
Although they are hard to kill.
Underwater teams, move!

1006
01:57:27,529 --> 01:57:29,496
And let go.

1007
01:57:32,499 --> 01:57:34,501
Release, release.

1008
01:57:39,506 --> 01:57:43,468
Here's our girl. Target in sight.
3-6 ready with harpoons.

1009
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:45,512
Let's go, kid.

1010
01:57:46,513 --> 01:57:50,517
We enter from below,
where their armor has holes.

1011
01:57:53,478 --> 01:57:57,524
Okay, let's go. Get in there.
- I'm coming in. Bring me closer.

1012
01:58:01,486 --> 01:58:02,945
Hold her steady.

1013
01:58:02,946 --> 01:58:04,531
In range. Activate one.

1014
01:58:04,572 --> 01:58:06,066
I activate, target engaged.

1015
01:58:06,067 --> 01:58:07,577
And one fired.

1016
01:58:13,748 --> 01:58:15,249
Another one ready.

1017
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:17,252
Activate one.
- I'm activating. -Fire away.

1018
01:58:21,506 --> 01:58:24,509
Good shot. Activate another.
- I'm activating. Another shot.

1019
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:27,387
To the balls!
-Fine.

1020
01:58:27,846 --> 01:58:29,639
3-6, you owe us a beer.

1021
01:58:34,477 --> 01:58:39,441
See, the balloons slow her down,
and keep it afloat. -Yes.

1022
01:58:39,524 --> 01:58:44,487
On her. Take me there.
Right on her. 30 meters.

1023
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:46,581
A harpoon with an explosive tip.

1024
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:50,493
Ten meters. Take me there.
Put me in your pocket.

1025
01:58:50,528 --> 01:58:55,498
Now calm, calm.
Wait. Wait.

1026
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,010
Go tighter!

1027
01:59:04,507 --> 01:59:07,510
Watch your ponytail, Colonel!

1028
01:59:17,479 --> 01:59:20,482
Full power back!
-Back to maximum, I understand.

1029
01:59:27,489 --> 01:59:29,532
Hold her.

1030
01:59:32,535 --> 01:59:39,501
She received an explosive harpoon in her chest
but he still runs away. Wonderful.

1031
02:00:53,533 --> 02:00:59,205
The only way to get to the gland is
from below. We drill through the hard palate

1032
02:00:59,914 --> 02:01:02,167
in the brain. And...

1033
02:01:05,795 --> 02:01:09,507
These are very intelligent beings.
Probably smarter than us.

1034
02:01:09,549 --> 02:01:12,218
They are not smarter than me.
- You set the criteria very low.

1035
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:14,429
I'm the one with the harpoon.

1036
02:01:15,555 --> 02:01:17,065
Yes.

1037
02:01:27,567 --> 02:01:32,530
How do you know? That they are smarter than us?
-More neurons, more connections.

1038
02:01:32,565 --> 02:01:36,576
Not only are they smarter,
they are deeply sensitive.

1039
02:01:37,827 --> 02:01:39,829
More spiritual.

1040
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:46,503
This area fits here
our emotional centers,

1041
02:01:46,544 --> 02:01:49,547
but proportionally it is much larger.

1042
02:01:50,215 --> 02:01:54,552
They have music, philosophy, mathematics...

1043
02:01:54,587 --> 02:01:57,514
A complex language.

1044
02:01:57,555 --> 02:02:02,519
Okay. We begin.
- Show me the money.

1045
02:02:06,523 --> 02:02:12,529
What is all this for?
-That's right. Amrita.

1046
02:02:14,572 --> 02:02:21,538
Unfortunately for the monstrous,
this miracle stops aging in humans.

1047
02:02:21,573 --> 02:02:23,083
It stops him completely.

1048
02:02:24,541 --> 02:02:30,547
Gram by gram, the most valuable
substance known to man.

1049
02:02:30,582 --> 02:02:36,511
This tube is worth about 80 million.

1050
02:02:36,553 --> 02:02:38,513
Think fast!

1051
02:02:38,555 --> 02:02:41,523
Please do not.
It's never funny.

1052
02:02:41,558 --> 02:02:46,396
Amrita finances everything
here on pandora now.

1053
02:02:46,521 --> 02:02:51,568
Even your research.
Right, Dr. G? - That's why I drink.

1054
02:02:53,528 --> 02:02:57,532
You just take it?
Throw away the rest?

1055
02:02:58,575 --> 02:03:02,502
Deflate the balloons.
Let's sink her!

1056
02:03:02,537 --> 02:03:06,541
Not. Leave the balloons.
I want them to know it was us.

1057
02:03:07,542 --> 02:03:10,545
I charge extra
when they use me as bait.

1058
02:03:45,246 --> 02:03:47,958
Her name is Ro'a.

1059
02:03:49,542 --> 02:03:52,545
She was my spiritual sister.

1060
02:03:55,548 --> 02:03:57,550
She composed songs.

1061
02:03:58,551 --> 02:04:02,514
Very respected.
We would sing together.

1062
02:04:02,555 --> 02:04:06,393
She waited many cycles
mating to get this cub.

1063
02:04:06,893 --> 02:04:09,312
The clan was very happy for her.

1064
02:04:12,524 --> 02:04:15,527
What is this, Tonovari?

1065
02:04:16,569 --> 02:04:19,531
What is this?

1066
02:04:38,133 --> 02:04:44,139
My spiritual sister and hers
the baby was killed by the Skymen.

1067
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:51,062
This war has come to us.
We knew that our people were being hunted by tulkunas.

1068
02:04:51,104 --> 02:04:56,151
But that was over the horizon,
far. Now it's here!

1069
02:05:00,113 --> 02:05:04,082
You have to understand
how Heavenly people think.

1070
02:05:04,117 --> 02:05:07,120
They are not interested in the Great Balance.
- We do not answer to the Heavenly People!

1071
02:05:07,155 --> 02:05:09,087
Listen up. Listen to him.

1072
02:05:09,122 --> 02:05:11,666
The people of heaven will not stop.
This is just the beginning.

1073
02:05:11,701 --> 02:05:13,877
Tell the tulkuns to leave.

1074
02:05:15,128 --> 02:05:17,130
Tell them to go away.

1075
02:05:17,165 --> 02:05:19,132
Shall they go?

1076
02:05:20,133 --> 02:05:24,095
You live among us and you haven't learned anything.

1077
02:05:24,137 --> 02:05:27,098
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

1078
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:29,142
No no.

1079
02:05:30,101 --> 02:05:34,105
If you attack, if you fight,
then they will destroy you.

1080
02:05:34,773 --> 02:05:37,150
It will destroy everything you love.

1081
02:05:38,109 --> 02:05:41,112
Not!
- Hear my words! Hear my words!

1082
02:05:41,154 --> 02:05:44,115
Calm down. Calm down!

1083
02:05:44,157 --> 02:05:48,119
Listen to my father. -Damn!
- He is telling the truth.

1084
02:05:57,128 --> 02:06:00,096
Tell the tulkuns,

1085
02:06:00,131 --> 02:06:05,136
if they get hit by one of these,
they are marked for death.

1086
02:06:07,138 --> 02:06:11,101
And call me, I'll shut him up.

1087
02:06:11,142 --> 02:06:15,105
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters. Is not it?

1088
02:06:18,108 --> 02:06:20,110
Saving your family.

1089
02:06:32,122 --> 02:06:34,124
Tell the tulkuns.

1090
02:06:35,125 --> 02:06:37,127
Go away. Go!

1091
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:44,092
We have to fight.

1092
02:06:44,134 --> 02:06:47,137
MaJake. I will not stand
and to do nothing.

1093
02:06:48,138 --> 02:06:54,102
It's a trap. They want us to fight back.
They don't hunt tulkuns. They are hunting us.

1094
02:07:09,117 --> 02:07:12,746
You're not going anywhere, little brother.
- I have to warn Pajakan about the transmitters.

1095
02:07:13,121 --> 02:07:16,089
Not. Your idiotic
the ass must stay here.

1096
02:07:16,124 --> 02:07:19,127
He is an exile. There is no one
other than me to warn him.

1097
02:07:19,162 --> 02:07:23,131
Bro, why do you always have to do so much
to aggravate the situation?

1098
02:07:25,133 --> 02:07:32,098
Not. You think why can't I be perfect
son like you? The perfect little soldier.

1099
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:36,061
Well, I'm not you! OK?

1100
02:07:36,102 --> 02:07:40,106
I'm not you.
He's my brother. I'm going.

1101
02:07:40,982 --> 02:07:45,028
He is your brother?
No, I'm your brother.

1102
02:07:45,063 --> 02:07:47,047
Lo'ak!

1103
02:07:47,082 --> 02:07:48,997
Let me.

1104
02:07:49,032 --> 02:07:53,036
Lo'ak! -Come back!
-Come on. He goes to Pajakan.

1105
02:08:05,048 --> 02:08:06,558
Come back!

1106
02:08:07,133 --> 02:08:10,0095
Here comes Lo'ak! Lo'ak!
- Lo'ak!

1107
02:08:10,136 --> 02:08:13,139
Lo'ak goes to find Pajakan!
-Wait!

1108
02:08:14,641 --> 02:08:16,151
Hold on.

1109
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:25,825
All crews in positions.

1110
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:29,322
Advertise a general call. - All right, people.
Come on. Let's make some money!

1111
02:08:37,622 --> 02:08:39,132
Brother!

1112
02:08:39,158 --> 02:08:40,668
Lo'ak!

1113
02:08:42,127 --> 02:08:44,129
Lo'ak!
- Stop!

1114
02:08:47,132 --> 02:08:49,134
What is it? What is wrong?

1115
02:08:50,135 --> 02:08:52,095
Shit!

1116
02:08:52,137 --> 02:08:56,141
Stay calm.
I will solve this.

1117
02:09:02,105 --> 02:09:04,065
Shit!

1118
02:09:05,775 --> 02:09:07,192
Lo'ak!

1119
02:09:07,193 --> 02:09:08,703
Brother, come on!
-Help me!

1120
02:09:09,321 --> 02:09:10,989
Hurry up, the ship is coming! There they are!

1121
02:09:13,825 --> 02:09:15,335
Brother, come on!

1122
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:19,212
Come on bro.
-Hurry up!

1123
02:09:19,247 --> 02:09:23,335
Report this! Call dad!
Call dad! Come on! Do it!

1124
02:09:23,376 --> 02:09:26,608
Just do it. - Dad, I mean,
Devil's dog. Can you hear me?

1125
02:09:26,643 --> 02:09:29,841
Did you see where they went?
- This is Eagle Eye, do you hear?

1126
02:09:29,876 --> 02:09:32,177
They went beyond the reef.
- Yes, Lo'ak. -Dad!

1127
02:09:32,886 --> 02:09:35,472
We are with the tulkun who is being attacked.

1128
02:09:35,889 --> 02:09:39,517
The killer ship arrives.
It is about 2 km away. - Who is with you?

1129
02:09:39,893 --> 02:09:43,355
All of us. Ao'nung and Tsireja too.
We are at Stena Three Brothers.

1130
02:09:43,396 --> 02:09:45,732
take cover,
and do not engage in combat. OK?

1131
02:09:45,767 --> 02:09:48,068
Can you hear me?
Do not engage in combat. On our way.

1132
02:09:48,151 --> 02:09:52,280
Yes sir. -Is approaching!
- Three, two, pull! - Pull!

1133
02:09:53,156 --> 02:09:54,699
Children are under attack!

1134
02:09:55,158 --> 02:09:58,286
Children were attacked.
Tulkun dams. And your children too.

1135
02:09:58,745 --> 02:10:01,414
A demon ship?
-Yes! We have to go!

1136
02:10:01,456 --> 02:10:04,167
Weapon.
Sound the alarm!

1137
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:10,173
You better stay.
- I will ride! Come on!

1138
02:11:00,181 --> 02:11:03,143
Underwater teams, close the hatch.
In two minutes!

1139
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:11,992
Ao'nung!

1140
02:11:12,027 --> 02:11:14,321
Hurry up! Come on! Brother, hurry!

1141
02:11:17,157 --> 02:11:18,667
Quick, quick!

1142
02:11:22,162 --> 02:11:23,672
Drag! Now!

1143
02:11:24,873 --> 02:11:27,167
All of! Together!
- Pull!

1144
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:34,466
I'll be damned.
Sally's children.

1145
02:11:35,133 --> 02:11:38,178
Here we go. You do not.
- Get on!

1146
02:11:49,773 --> 02:11:53,401
Distance 700 meters.
The transmitter signal is good.

1147
02:11:55,153 --> 02:11:57,926
Pull harder!
- Pull!

1148
02:11:57,961 --> 02:12:00,700
Pull harder!
-Come on!

1149
02:12:01,201 --> 02:12:04,871
He was taken out!
Kiri, it's taken out! -Go. Tuk, go.

1150
02:12:04,913 --> 02:12:08,375
Come on. Get out of here!
Go there! I'll get them out of here.

1151
02:12:08,416 --> 02:12:10,814
Okay.
- Lo'ak, come on.

1152
02:12:10,849 --> 02:12:13,213
Spiders! Come on, dive in!

1153
02:12:13,254 --> 02:12:16,174
Dive in!
- Knock, get a hold of yourself.

1154
02:12:25,183 --> 02:12:28,103
Distance 300 meters.
-Ready the depth charges

1155
02:12:28,144 --> 02:12:30,146
and fire, fire, fire.

1156
02:12:36,194 --> 02:12:41,157
No depth charges. Scoresby, are you listening?
These children are worthless dead to me.

1157
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,660
Don't shoot.

1158
02:12:47,914 --> 02:12:52,043
Surround. Make a cordon around them.
Drop the submarines into the water.

1159
02:12:52,794 --> 02:12:55,755
Underwater teams, get excited.

1160
02:13:44,179 --> 02:13:46,389
Crabs go to the right.
Surround them.

1161
02:13:50,143 --> 02:13:53,104
Don't lose them. Follow them.
- Wings up! We're going in!

1162
02:13:53,146 --> 02:13:55,106
Extra!

1163
02:14:26,179 --> 02:14:28,223
Target captured.
Two fired.

1164
02:14:57,168 --> 02:14:59,170
Where is Tuck?
Have you seen her?

1165
02:15:16,146 --> 02:15:17,656
Knock!

1166
02:15:19,816 --> 02:15:21,401
Target in sight.

1167
02:15:25,155 --> 02:15:27,532
It's coming!
-We have to go!

1168
02:15:44,341 --> 02:15:46,343
Go online.
- I'm transferring. -Fire away.

1169
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:09,289
Hold on!
- Let me out!

1170
02:16:09,324 --> 02:16:11,368
Watch out! - Knock, move!
- Move your hand!

1171
02:16:11,403 --> 02:16:13,244
Cut her!
-Hurry up!

1172
02:16:17,624 --> 02:16:20,335
Kid, come back here!

1173
02:16:25,340 --> 02:16:28,343
Put down the weapon. - Throw the weapon down!
- Put him down. -Put him down!

1174
02:16:30,345 --> 02:16:31,971
Stay down.

1175
02:16:32,006 --> 02:16:33,598
Catch him!

1176
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:35,433
Put the weapon down!

1177
02:16:35,475 --> 02:16:39,020
Throw it away, now! Put him down!
- Drop the knife. Throw it.

1178
02:16:40,271 --> 02:16:44,109
What are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it. Don't hurt them.

1179
02:16:44,567 --> 02:16:45,985
Beforestop moving.
- Spider!

1180
02:16:45,986 --> 02:16:50,323
Brother, are you okay?
-Yes. Awesome, bro. Never better.

1181
02:16:53,326 --> 02:16:55,412
Stop. Lie still.
-Shut!

1182
02:16:57,330 --> 02:17:01,293
Return to the bridge.
Hold it there!

1183
02:17:01,334 --> 02:17:03,336
I'm going, I'm going.

1184
02:17:03,795 --> 02:17:09,009
Yes. I remember you.
Tie them to the fence. All of them.

1185
02:17:09,050 --> 02:17:12,304
Here we go! -Here we go. Move!
- Over here.

1186
02:17:12,345 --> 02:17:16,308
Watch out for them. They bite.
-Kneel down. Get on your knees.

1187
02:17:16,349 --> 02:17:18,310
Give me your hand.
-Not!

1188
02:17:19,311 --> 02:17:21,313
Now the second one.
-Not.

1189
02:17:24,316 --> 02:17:26,318
Be brave.

1190
02:17:30,322 --> 02:17:31,906
The Na'vi are coming!

1191
02:17:34,326 --> 02:17:37,579
Spread yourself out. Weapons up.
-Dad! - Drive left. Spread yourself out.

1192
02:17:40,165 --> 02:17:42,375
Stop. Stop them.

1193
02:17:44,377 --> 02:17:46,379
It's Sally.

1194
02:17:48,381 --> 02:17:50,383
300 meters.

1195
02:17:56,097 --> 02:18:00,018
They have our children.
Your daughter. Knock. Lo'ak.

1196
02:18:03,021 --> 02:18:07,067
Jake, tell yours
friends to step down.

1197
02:18:07,102 --> 02:18:12,072
If you want your children back,
come alone

1198
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:16,201
You know it's not smart to test
my resolve.

1199
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,286
Lo'ak! Not.

1200
02:18:21,081 --> 02:18:26,044
I took you under my wing, Jake.
You betrayed me.

1201
02:18:26,086 --> 02:18:28,755
You were killing your fellow man.
Good men. Good women.

1202
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:32,300
I will not hesitate to kill your children.

1203
02:18:33,551 --> 02:18:36,096
Wait a minute.

1204
02:18:46,064 --> 02:18:48,024
Stay here.

1205
02:18:48,066 --> 02:18:54,072
They are tulkun killers.
They must die. Here. Today.

1206
02:18:54,107 --> 02:18:57,492
They want me.
That's what this is all about, okay?

1207
02:18:57,527 --> 02:19:00,078
Hunting for our tulkuns.
The kidnapping of our children.

1208
02:19:03,081 --> 02:19:07,085
You put this on our necks!
You!

1209
02:19:10,088 --> 02:19:13,091
Then I have to do this.

1210
02:19:18,096 --> 02:19:22,058
Offer expires soon.
What have you decided?

1211
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:26,021
Don't shoot. I am coming.

1212
02:19:36,072 --> 02:19:38,074
MaJake, what's going on?

1213
02:19:39,075 --> 02:19:41,077
MaJake?

1214
02:19:43,079 --> 02:19:46,082
Be on the lookout, folks.
All weapons.

1215
02:20:03,058 --> 02:20:06,895
Easy hit.
- If you hit him now, they will attack.

1216
02:20:08,271 --> 02:20:09,781
Wait until he's on board.

1217
02:20:37,092 --> 02:20:39,094
Spider!

1218
02:20:50,063 --> 02:20:52,023
Shoot. Shoot!

1219
02:20:54,067 --> 02:20:55,610
Brother!

1220
02:20:59,155 --> 02:21:02,158
Turn!
- I'm turning! - Turn me around!

1221
02:21:03,118 --> 02:21:07,080
Put me in position to shoot!
Come on, come on!

1222
02:21:26,099 --> 02:21:29,060
Turn me around! Quick, quick!

1223
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:33,565
Get in there so I can be in range.
Quick, quick.

1224
02:21:42,073 --> 02:21:44,075
Down!

1225
02:21:46,077 --> 02:21:48,079
Damn!

1226
02:21:52,083 --> 02:21:54,085
Shoot! Shoot!

1227
02:21:58,632 --> 02:22:02,135
Sally approaches. Keep an eye on him.
- Okay, let's go.

1228
02:22:02,177 --> 02:22:04,095
Get on. We're taking off.

1229
02:22:45,095 --> 02:22:47,097
Someone guess something!

1230
02:23:03,071 --> 02:23:04,614
Stop!

1231
02:23:59,586 --> 02:24:02,088
After them! Come on!

1232
02:24:18,063 --> 02:24:20,148
Breakthrough! Put on your masks!

1233
02:24:20,357 --> 02:24:21,867
Put on your masks! Come on!

1234
02:25:01,064 --> 02:25:03,024
Get him out of here!
-Come on!

1235
02:25:07,570 --> 02:25:09,114
Calm down!

1236
02:25:23,086 --> 02:25:24,596
Faster, faster!

1237
02:25:37,475 --> 02:25:41,021
Damage report!
-The flood! Sections two and three.

1238
02:25:41,056 --> 02:25:43,023
Are you OK?

1239
02:26:12,135 --> 02:26:14,929
To the left of the bow!
- Sharp left!

1240
02:26:14,964 --> 02:26:16,640
Shoot!

1241
02:26:16,973 --> 02:26:18,483
Put me in position to shoot!

1242
02:26:19,142 --> 02:26:20,652
I got you!

1243
02:26:37,577 --> 02:26:40,545
Untie us!
- He doesn't react!

1244
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:44,584
Get us off the hook!
- Who has the harpoon now?

1245
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:51,132
Backwards with maximum power!

1246
02:27:02,102 --> 02:27:04,062
Recharge!

1247
02:27:06,106 --> 02:27:09,109
No cable, idiot!

1248
02:27:09,150 --> 02:27:11,111
We can't sail anymore.

1249
02:27:11,152 --> 02:27:15,538
Water seeps in. Pumps on.
- To weapons!

1250
02:27:15,573 --> 02:27:18,618
I thought it was you
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

1251
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:20,370
Shut up, Garvin.

1252
02:27:21,121 --> 02:27:25,090
Where are you?
Insolent rascal.

1253
02:27:25,125 --> 02:27:28,128
You think you're very smart, don't you?

1254
02:27:43,059 --> 02:27:44,603
Bend down!

1255
02:27:56,031 --> 02:27:57,531
The pumps are not working.
- Abandon the ship!

1256
02:27:57,532 --> 02:28:00,201
Abandon ship! Get him on the boat.
-Yes sir!

1257
02:28:00,236 --> 02:28:02,412
Let's go, narowhat! Move! Put on your masks!

1258
02:28:08,126 --> 02:28:12,088
We don't care! - Hello, kid
brother. Do you need help?

1259
02:28:12,130 --> 02:28:15,133
Shut. Come on.
Set us free.

1260
02:28:17,135 --> 02:28:20,138
Get Tuk out of here.
- Brother, hurry!

1261
02:28:21,139 --> 02:28:26,061
Who is the mighty warrior? Come on. Say.
- Brother! -Come on. Here we go.

1262
02:28:28,063 --> 02:28:30,357
Lo'ak!
- They have Spider.

1263
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:32,651
We have to save him. Come on.

1264
02:28:33,234 --> 02:28:35,403
Come on bro.
We can't leave him.

1265
02:28:43,244 --> 02:28:44,754
Let me!

1266
02:28:47,123 --> 02:28:48,633
Not!

1267
02:28:50,126 --> 02:28:51,636
See!

1268
02:28:57,133 --> 02:29:02,097
Let's go, baby. Get up.
- I'm not your soul, pervert!

1269
02:29:02,138 --> 02:29:05,100
We have to go back for her.
- Knock, stop!

1270
02:29:05,141 --> 02:29:08,061
The Salis stick together.

1271
02:29:18,154 --> 02:29:19,906
Hang in there, folks. Wait.

1272
02:29:20,407 --> 02:29:22,033
OK. You can board!

1273
02:29:23,618 --> 02:29:26,746
Check the mask. Check if it is
popular. -I'm fine, dumbass.

1274
02:29:29,416 --> 02:29:33,420
Hurry up! This is an evacuation, folks.
Here we go!

1275
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:38,633
Tuk, this is not a good idea.
Knock!

1276
02:30:00,113 --> 02:30:01,906
Cut here.

1277
02:30:04,159 --> 02:30:05,952
Not!

1278
02:30:10,832 --> 02:30:12,342
I have her.

1279
02:30:18,632 --> 02:30:20,967
We can still do this.
-You bet.

1280
02:30:21,509 --> 02:30:24,220
I can't believe I'm tied up again.

1281
02:30:25,472 --> 02:30:27,015
Hurry up guys.

1282
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:52,332
Brother, come on.
-Here we go.

1283
02:30:56,336 --> 02:30:57,846
Thanks guys.

1284
02:30:59,464 --> 02:31:02,384
Here we go! -Not!
-Brother, come on! - Quick, quick!

1285
02:31:03,426 --> 02:31:05,345
Run, run!

1286
02:31:07,180 --> 02:31:09,182
Give me that.

1287
02:31:12,269 --> 02:31:14,312
Go, go!
- This way.

1288
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:23,863
Take cover!

1289
02:31:29,619 --> 02:31:31,329
Do you see them?

1290
02:31:41,339 --> 02:31:44,342
Brother! That was crazy, bro.

1291
02:31:49,347 --> 02:31:51,808
Climb up!
- Come on, bro.

1292
02:31:51,906 --> 02:31:54,868
You idiot. I am affected.

1293
02:31:58,329 --> 02:32:01,332
Shit! Help me!

1294
02:32:04,043 --> 02:32:05,553
Hold it up!
- I'm holding him.

1295
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:07,090
Come on.

1296
02:32:10,049 --> 02:32:12,051
Catch him.
- Bro, I got it.

1297
02:32:13,011 --> 02:32:16,014
Curse.
- Straighten him up!

1298
02:32:17,972 --> 02:32:19,898
Brother, come on.

1299
02:32:19,933 --> 02:32:22,593
It's okay bro. I'm holding you.
-Hurry up! Come on, come on!

1300
02:32:23,607 --> 02:32:25,574
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1301
02:32:25,907 --> 02:32:27,909
I can't go back.

1302
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:37,669
Dad! Dad, help!
It's Netejam!

1303
02:32:38,211 --> 02:32:40,672
Hurry up!
-Here is! Take it.

1304
02:32:42,215 --> 02:32:44,301
Oh no.
- Netejam is injured!

1305
02:32:44,468 --> 02:32:47,304
Jake. -Come on. Come on.
-Hurry up, please!

1306
02:32:47,345 --> 02:32:49,264
Drag!

1307
02:32:51,266 --> 02:32:52,760
Brother, watch his head.

1308
02:32:52,761 --> 02:32:54,271
Drag!

1309
02:32:54,478 --> 02:32:56,021
Come on!

1310
02:32:58,273 --> 02:33:00,025
Just watch his head.

1311
02:33:00,484 --> 02:33:02,027
Okay.

1312
02:33:02,277 --> 02:33:05,280
It's okay bro. We will help you.
-Oh no.

1313
02:33:07,282 --> 02:33:10,285
Press. Press it.

1314
02:33:11,448 --> 02:33:13,325
Dad, I...
-It's fine. I'm here.

1315
02:33:15,832 --> 02:33:17,342
No no.

1316
02:33:17,626 --> 02:33:19,586
It's okay, son.
I'm here.

1317
02:33:24,216 --> 02:33:26,259
I want to go home.

1318
02:33:28,261 --> 02:33:32,265
I know. It's okay, let's go home.
Go home.

1319
02:33:34,226 --> 02:33:35,684
Go home.

1320
02:33:35,685 --> 02:33:38,271
It's fine.
- Dad, I...

1321
02:33:45,237 --> 02:33:46,747
We don't...

1322
02:33:51,243 --> 02:33:53,495
Not. No no.

1323
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:55,747
We don't care!

1324
02:34:03,255 --> 02:34:08,385
Great mother. No, Great Mother.
Please.

1325
02:34:09,261 --> 02:34:13,348
Oh, my son. My son.

1326
02:34:13,383 --> 02:34:14,893
Not!

1327
02:34:19,354 --> 02:34:22,315
My son!

1328
02:34:25,068 --> 02:34:26,611
Not!

1329
02:34:28,029 --> 02:34:29,539
Not!

1330
02:34:30,365 --> 02:34:33,368
Can you hear me, Corporal?

1331
02:34:34,369 --> 02:34:37,831
Yes, I think you hear me.

1332
02:34:37,866 --> 02:34:41,293
I have your daughters.

1333
02:34:42,294 --> 02:34:44,296
Same offer as before.

1334
02:34:45,297 --> 02:34:47,299
You for them.

1335
02:34:47,334 --> 02:34:48,844
Not!

1336
02:34:51,344 --> 02:34:54,347
Where are your sisters?

1337
02:34:55,348 --> 02:34:57,315
Your sisters. Where are they?

1338
02:34:57,350 --> 02:35:01,319
I do not know. -Where are they?
- They are tied up on the ship.

1339
02:35:01,354 --> 02:35:06,359
They are by the moon pool.
At the shaft through the deck. In the middle of the ship.

1340
02:35:06,394 --> 02:35:08,904
What?
-Come on. I will show you.

1341
02:35:09,196 --> 02:35:12,115
Come on. I will show you.
- Call me, corporal. -Come on.

1342
02:35:12,157 --> 02:35:16,328
Zee, up at the top. - I need something,
Jake, or there will be consequences.

1343
02:35:16,369 --> 02:35:18,330
I hear you.

1344
02:35:18,705 --> 02:35:23,668
Here we go. -Here we go!
-Here we go. We have to go. Let's go.

1345
02:35:24,628 --> 02:35:27,089
Not! -Here we go.
Listen. Listen to me.

1346
02:35:28,632 --> 02:35:31,676
Listen to me.
They hold our daughters.

1347
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:34,471
They hold our daughters.

1348
02:35:36,681 --> 02:35:41,645
I need you to be with me.
And you have to be strong.

1349
02:35:42,187 --> 02:35:45,857
Now. With a strong heart.

1350
02:35:46,566 --> 02:35:49,194
With a strong heart.

1351
02:36:01,206 --> 02:36:04,167
Let's go get our daughters.

1352
02:36:17,723 --> 02:36:20,726
You stay with your brother.
- Dad, I want to go with you.

1353
02:36:24,229 --> 02:36:28,191
You've done enough.
-Dad...

1354
02:36:30,694 --> 02:36:32,204
Don't shoot.

1355
02:36:33,405 --> 02:36:34,915
Here we go.

1356
02:36:35,365 --> 02:36:37,325
He is coming.

1357
02:36:38,368 --> 02:36:40,328
I caught myself. Come on, come on!

1358
02:36:41,747 --> 02:36:44,374
Let's take care of this guy.
That's why we came here.

1359
02:36:49,337 --> 02:36:52,299
Stay with him.
-Not...

1360
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:55,343
Be careful guys.

1361
02:37:15,447 --> 02:37:16,957
Come on.

1362
02:37:24,498 --> 02:37:27,501
Where are they? - Middle deck.
Where they launch submarines.

1363
02:37:27,536 --> 02:37:31,505
There is a pool in the middle.
They are by the bow rail.

1364
02:37:33,507 --> 02:37:35,509
No no. Stay there.

1365
02:37:37,969 --> 02:37:41,890
Come on in, Corporal. This ship is sinking
and your girls with him.

1366
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:48,855
Your son didn't have to die.
It's your fault.

1367
02:37:54,945 --> 02:37:58,865
You thought you could protect the family,
but you can't.

1368
02:38:00,158 --> 02:38:01,868
Only in one way
you can protect them.

1369
02:38:05,872 --> 02:38:09,835
Let's get this over with
before you lose another child.

1370
02:38:20,470 --> 02:38:22,597
Lay down!

1371
02:39:03,889 --> 02:39:06,433
Who is affected?
- Zdinarsik, do you hear? -I'm here!

1372
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:08,110
Clean!

1373
02:39:08,602 --> 02:39:10,604
Preigers. Do you hear?

1374
02:39:11,938 --> 02:39:13,899
Look up. Look up!

1375
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:23,750
Forward!

1376
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:27,170
Force left. Go!

1377
02:39:27,329 --> 02:39:28,839
Force right. Go around her.

1378
02:39:28,865 --> 02:39:30,540
Does anyone see anything?

1379
02:40:15,711 --> 02:40:17,254
MaJake!

1380
02:40:22,968 --> 02:40:24,478
It's mom!

1381
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:33,603
That's right.
They're coming for you.

1382
02:41:24,613 --> 02:41:26,123
Dad! Dad.

1383
02:41:29,242 --> 02:41:32,579
Where is your sister?
Where is she? -There.

1384
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:36,083
Okay, stay behind me.

1385
02:41:39,586 --> 02:41:41,546
Kiri!

1386
02:41:41,588 --> 02:41:43,340
Time is running out, Corporal.

1387
02:41:44,966 --> 02:41:48,970
You already lost one child today.
Do you really want to lose another one?

1388
02:41:49,012 --> 02:41:51,285
Don't challenge me!

1389
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:53,558
Just kill him, dad!

1390
02:41:54,226 --> 02:41:55,769
Kiri!

1391
02:41:56,686 --> 02:41:59,689
Weapons down. -Do not.
Do not do that. -Down!

1392
02:42:01,691 --> 02:42:03,693
Kick them away.

1393
02:42:05,278 --> 02:42:06,788
Do it!

1394
02:42:09,741 --> 02:42:11,625
Not.

1395
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:14,663
Put the handcuffs on. -Not! Do not
to hurt her, okay?

1396
02:42:14,705 --> 02:42:19,626
Stop there! -Do not!
-Do not move! Not a step.

1397
02:42:19,668 --> 02:42:23,630
Put the handcuffs on. Immediately.
-Bastard!

1398
02:42:23,672 --> 02:42:25,674
Please don't hurt her.

1399
02:42:28,719 --> 02:42:31,722
Let go. Or I cut.

1400
02:42:34,683 --> 02:42:36,685
You think I care about some kid?

1401
02:42:37,686 --> 02:42:41,690
He is not mine.
We're not even the same species.

1402
02:42:41,732 --> 02:42:46,695
Please don't hurt her.
Please let her go.

1403
02:42:46,737 --> 02:42:48,884
Do not. -Please!
- Don't kill him.

1404
02:42:48,919 --> 02:42:52,624
Listen to me! Let her go.
Don't hurt her.

1405
02:42:52,659 --> 02:42:56,329
Mom, don't kill him.
-Son for son.

1406
02:42:57,706 --> 02:42:59,249
Please don't hurt her.

1407
02:43:01,168 --> 02:43:05,505
I'm cutting. - Please let her go.
OK? Just let her go.

1408
02:43:07,674 --> 02:43:09,718
Not!

1409
02:43:17,726 --> 02:43:19,269
Kiri... Kiri.

1410
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:21,280
Kiri.

1411
02:43:26,735 --> 02:43:30,697
Spiders.
- Spider, get them out of here.

14 12
02:43:30,739 --> 02:43:34,743
Come on. Society. Knock.
- I owe you death.

1413
02:43:36,703 --> 02:43:39,206
Mum. -Mum.
- Come on. -Come on.

1414
02:43:39,373 --> 02:43:40,883
Please. Mum.

1415
02:43:41,375 --> 02:43:43,147
You're not going, are you, Jake?

1416
02:43:43,182 --> 02:43:44,920
When you know I'm out there somewhere.

1417
02:43:45,921 --> 02:43:48,090
When you know I'll never give up.

1418
02:43:48,382 --> 02:43:52,135
I'll come get you. And when I come
I will kill your whole family.

1419
02:43:53,720 --> 02:43:55,230
Dad...

1420
02:43:56,181 --> 02:43:57,724
Let's wrap this up then.

1421
02:44:08,485 --> 02:44:10,195
Jake!

1422
02:44:13,198 --> 02:44:18,203
It's coming! -Back. Back to the ship! Come on!
-Tuk, swim.

1423
02:44:20,205 --> 02:44:22,833
Stay close. - Keep going.
-Stay close. -Come on.

1424
02:44:25,127 --> 02:44:26,670
Knock!

1425
02:44:27,337 --> 02:44:30,132
Mom, take my hand!
-Hold on!

1426
02:44:32,134 --> 02:44:34,177
Mum!

1427
02:44:35,178 --> 02:44:37,806
Kiri, come on. -Not...
-Kiri, we have to go. Come on. -Not!

1428
02:44:41,184 --> 02:44:43,145
Come on! Climb up!
Climb up!

1429
02:44:43,186 --> 02:44:46,189
Kiri, come on!
Come on let's go!

1430
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:50,193
Mum! -Swim! Swim.
Come on, Tuck. Climb up!

1431
02:44:59,411 --> 02:45:00,921
Mum...
-Come on!

1432
02:45:01,413 --> 02:45:02,923
Go, go, go!

1433
02:45:09,171 --> 02:45:11,131
Keep climbing!
Come on!

1434
02:45:15,177 --> 02:45:17,179
I'm holding you.

1435
02:45:18,472 --> 02:45:20,182
Give me your hand! Come on!

1436
02:45:22,893 --> 02:45:24,436
Open them!

1437
02:45:32,194 --> 02:45:35,155
Open them!
- Step back. Step back.

1438
02:45:35,197 --> 02:45:36,707
Come on.

1439
02:45:37,657 --> 02:45:39,201
Knock!

1440
02:45:48,168 --> 02:45:51,129
Climb up! Come on!

1441
02:45:52,672 --> 02:45:54,883
Climb up! Come on!

1442
02:45:55,258 --> 02:45:56,843
Go up!

1443
02:46:01,932 --> 02:46:04,768
We're rolling! Go Go!
-Okay...

1444
02:46:07,312 --> 02:46:08,855
Not!
-Mum!

1445
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:20,033
Kiri! Move on!

1446
02:46:23,620 --> 02:46:25,622
Over here!
-Okay.

1447
02:46:26,039 --> 02:46:27,549
Come on!

1448
02:46:30,711 --> 02:46:32,713
Open them!

1449
02:46:34,673 --> 02:46:36,183
Mum!

1450
02:46:38,885 --> 02:46:40,395
Come on!

1451
02:46:49,396 --> 02:46:51,398
Go, Tuck!

1452
02:46:52,399 --> 02:46:54,443
There is no way out!

1453
02:46:55,777 --> 02:46:58,780
Let's stay together, okay?
-Yes. - Let's stay together. -Yes.

1454
02:47:28,185 --> 02:47:31,188
Great mother.
Great mother, help us!

1455
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:15,690
Kiri!

1456
02:48:35,669 --> 02:48:39,422
Brother!
- Mom and Dad are down there. In the ship.

1457
02:48:39,457 --> 02:48:43,176
Get a hold of yourself.
- Brother, I caught myself. Come on!

1458
02:49:10,203 --> 02:49:12,164
Okay.

1459
02:49:39,191 --> 02:49:40,701
Jake!

1460
02:50:17,187 --> 02:50:18,697
Dad.

1461
02:50:22,192 --> 02:50:23,702
Fuck!

1462
02:50:38,208 --> 02:50:40,127
Come on son of a bitch!

1463
02:50:40,168 --> 02:50:42,670
Dad, breathe.
- I don't care?

1464
02:50:42,705 --> 02:50:45,138
No, Dad.
I am Lo'ak.

1465
02:50:45,173 --> 02:50:49,142
Oh, Lo'ak.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1466
02:50:49,177 --> 02:50:52,305
I feel sorry for Netejam. It's my fault.
- Just focus.

1467
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:53,850
Focus on this now.

1468
02:51:12,784 --> 02:51:16,246
We're losing the air pocket.
Come on. We have to go. Come on, Dad.

1469
02:51:23,879 --> 02:51:28,216
Do you know how to get out? -I think I know.
But, Dad, he's going to have to hold his breath for a long time.

1470
02:51:28,884 --> 02:51:34,222
I can't stand it.
You can. You must leave now. -Not.

1471
02:51:34,257 --> 02:51:38,226
I can't lose you either, Dad.
Please.

1472
02:51:41,521 --> 02:51:43,231
Mom, I'm scared.

1473
02:51:44,232 --> 02:51:49,237
Everything is fine.
Stay close to me. Stay close to mom.

1474
02:51:52,324 --> 02:51:54,284
It's fine.

1475
02:52:09,216 --> 02:52:12,052
You just have to slow down your heart rate.

1476
02:52:12,087 --> 02:52:13,597
Be very calm.

1477
02:52:14,388 --> 02:52:15,898
Breathe from here.

1478
02:52:16,348 --> 02:52:17,974
Breathe from here.

1479
02:52:31,238 --> 02:52:35,242
The path of water has no beginning and no end.

1480
02:52:36,243 --> 02:52:40,205
The sea is around you and in you.

1481
02:52:40,247 --> 02:52:44,167
The sea is your home before your birth
and after your death.

1482
02:52:48,964 --> 02:52:52,843
The sea gives
and the sea takes

1483
02:52:53,176 --> 02:52:55,220
Water connects all things.

1484
02:52:57,222 --> 02:52:59,224
Life and death.

1485
02:53:00,767 --> 02:53:02,769
Darkness and light.

1486
02:53:26,168 --> 02:53:28,170
Bye.
- Kiri. - Kiri.

1487
02:53:28,211 --> 02:53:34,176
Everything's gonna be alright, sis.
Mom, I'll give you this.

1488
02:53:38,221 --> 02:53:40,723
That will help you.

1489
02:53:40,758 --> 02:53:43,191
Dad, you can do this.

1490
02:53:43,226 --> 02:53:47,230
Trust me. Calm your heart.

1491
02:53:48,231 --> 02:53:50,233
Take a deep breath.

1492
02:53:53,236 --> 02:53:55,238
Last breath.

1493
02:53:59,201 --> 02:54:00,744
Follow me.

1494
02:55:16,820 --> 02:55:19,072
Hold on. Just breathe.

1495
02:55:19,698 --> 02:55:21,208
Just breathe.

1496
02:55:25,245 --> 02:55:26,755
Thank you.

1497
02:55:35,172 --> 02:55:37,215
I see you, son.

1498
02:55:40,177 --> 02:55:42,185
MaJake!

1499
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:45,223
Dad! -Mum!
-Dad. Dad.

1500
02:55:46,641 --> 02:55:49,186
Come on. Come here.

1501
02:55:49,227 --> 02:55:52,230
Knock! -I got you.
-Here is.

1502
02:55:57,235 --> 02:55:58,745
Brother.

1503
02:56:07,788 --> 02:56:10,749
The Salis stick together.

1504
02:56:11,967 --> 02:56:14,928
That was our biggest weakness

1505
02:56:14,963 --> 02:56:17,323
and our great strength.

1506
02:56:18,438 --> 02:56:20,763
Thank you, Great Mother.

1507
02:56:21,065 --> 02:56:22,608
Thank you.

1508
02:57:01,313 --> 02:57:03,315
Here we go.

1509
02:57:08,631 --> 02:57:10,633
Son...

1510
02:57:11,942 --> 02:57:13,944
Come with me.

1511
02:57:17,598 --> 02:57:19,108
Spiders!

1512
02:57:53,133 --> 02:57:54,643
Monkey!

1513
02:57:58,138 --> 02:58:00,140
Spiders.

1514
02:58:07,148 --> 02:58:09,150
Are you OK?
-Yes.

1515
02:58:12,153 --> 02:58:14,155
Come here.

1516
02:58:16,157 --> 02:58:19,118
Son for son.

1517
02:58:35,134 --> 02:58:38,137
Every songbook must
to have the last bead.

1518
02:59:03,103 --> 02:59:07,295
Father protects. That is its purpose.

1519
02:59:35,798 --> 02:59:39,760
People say it's all energy
just borrowed.

1520
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:44,723
And that one day you have to bring her back.

1521
02:59:56,777 --> 03:00:01,782
Eva carries all her children in her heart.

1522
03:00:01,817 --> 03:00:03,784
Nothing is ever lost.

1523
03:00:06,787 --> 03:00:09,790
I don't care!
- I don't care!

1524
03:00:29,727 --> 03:00:33,430
My family and me
we leave tomorrow

1525
03:00:33,808 --> 03:00:35,441
Far away from here.

1526
03:00:35,889 --> 03:00:42,782
Your son rests with our ancestors.
You are Metkajina now.

1527
03:00:47,584 --> 03:00:50,587
And so it happened.

1528
03:00:51,069 --> 03:00:53,071
We are the Sea People now.

1529
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:58,045
This is our home.

1530
03:01:57,169 --> 03:02:01,131
Dad! Look what I caught!

1531
03:02:03,467 --> 03:02:04,977
It's big.

1532
03:02:05,177 --> 03:02:11,183
She was there in that pool.
At the stones. Where you said.

1533
03:02:14,854 --> 03:02:18,858
What's up, dad?
Why are you crying?

1534
03:02:20,877 --> 03:02:23,195
I'm just happy to see you, boy.

1535
03:02:25,156 --> 03:02:27,158
I'm happy to see you too.

1536
03:02:29,118 --> 03:02:31,162
Here is. You try it.

1537
03:02:33,122 --> 03:02:34,632
Okay.

1538
03:02:35,624 --> 03:02:39,170
Did you leave any for me?
-Maybe.

1539
03:02:44,884 --> 03:02:46,850
Look at that. You see?

1540
03:02:54,207 --> 03:02:55,717
I see now.

1541
03:02:56,547 --> 03:02:58,706
I can't save my family by running away.

1542
03:02:59,820 --> 03:03:03,377
This is our home.
This is our fortress.

1543
03:03:04,733 --> 03:03:07,111
We will resist here.
